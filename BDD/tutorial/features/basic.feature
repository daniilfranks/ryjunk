Feature: Showing off behave (tutorial01)

    As a having the role as a newbie
    I want  to understand how to compose a feature
    So that the benefit is that I can start using BDD/gherkin

Scenario: Run a simple test
    Given we have behave installed
    When we implement a test
    Then behave will test it for us!
