    Feature: Showing off behave (tutorial01)

    As a having the role as a newbie
    I want  to understand how to compose a feature
    So that the benefit is that I can start using BDD/gherkin

    Background:
      Given that I have a table
      | test1 |  test2 |
      | data1 |  data2 |
 
    Scenario: Run a simple test
      Given we have behave installed
      When we implement a test
      Then behave will test it for us!
