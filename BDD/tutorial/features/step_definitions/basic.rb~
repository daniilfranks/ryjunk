# You can implement step definitions for undefined steps with these snippets:

Given(/^we have behave installed$/) do
  #pending # Write code here that turns the phrase above into concrete actions
  puts 'We have cucumber installed!'
  @kalle = 1
end

When(/^we implement a test$/) do
  #pending # Write code here that turns the phrase above into concrete actions
  @kalle+=1
  assert true
end

Then(/^behave will test it for us!$/) do
  #pending # Write code here that turns the phrase above into concrete actions
  assert @kalle == 2
end
