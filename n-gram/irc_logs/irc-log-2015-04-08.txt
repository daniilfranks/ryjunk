2015-04-08 00:51 <inavele> continue.
2015-04-08 00:51 <inavele> Make sure that `gem install do_postgres -v '0.10.14'` succeeds before bundling.
2015-04-08 00:51 <inavele> sorry
2015-04-08 00:51 <centrx> There's probably more before that message, that history of how this error came to be
2015-04-08 00:51 <centrx> but what happens when you do the gem install ?

2015-04-08 01:29 <baweaver> sevenseacat: Defora is an actual OS
2015-04-08 01:29 <baweaver> was that by sheer luck or knowledge?
2015-04-08 01:29 <sevenseacat> sheer luck
2015-04-08 01:29 <baweaver> Go figure.
2015-04-08 01:29 <jhass> reminds me of http://forkfedora.org/
2015-04-08 01:29 <jhass> ooh, it's down :(
2015-04-08 01:30 <baweaver> Mint has an odd habit of deprecating package repos on older versions
2015-04-08 01:30 <baweaver> or rather not updating it properly.
2015-04-08 01:30 <sevenseacat> mint i dont understand
2015-04-08 01:30 <baweaver> Mostly people who want Ubuntu but don't like the design choices it took to
2015-04-08 01:31 <sevenseacat> well it did make some shitty decisions
2015-04-08 01:31 <baweaver> they beat Windows to the "Looks like a phone" game
2015-04-08 01:31 <inavele> I like gnome 3
2015-04-08 01:31 <sevenseacat> i dislike everything about gnome 3
2015-04-08 01:31 <baweaver> Cinnamon is a decent GUI, I'll give that to them.

2015-04-08 01:53 <bradland> oh, you mean when binding.pry is the last line of a method.
2015-04-08 01:53 <bradland> i thought you meant last line of a file
2015-04-08 01:53 <bradland> that makes more sense
2015-04-08 01:53 <bradland> yeah, placing anything on the last line of a method would be considered a material change to the method, because that's going to change it's return value, no?
2015-04-08 01:54 <pipework> Not neccesarily methods.

2015-04-08 03:10 <nycjv321> I think I figured it out
2015-04-08 03:10 <jhass> iirc you can pass a block to and_return
2015-04-08 03:11 <jhass> and thus closure over an array and pop off the values or something
2015-04-08 03:13 <nycjv321> yea figured it out.

2015-04-08 04:27 <mozzarella> use enumerators

2015-04-08 04:32 <woop> do this without really gross side effects
2015-04-08 04:33 <woop> I could totally see doing it with "idiomatic ruby" if the data were in different data structures

2015-04-08 05:07 <jxf> Is there a built-in way to get a lazy enumerator which returns [0, 1, 2, 3, ...] indefinitely?
2015-04-08 05:07 braincrash has quit [Ping timeout: 265 seconds]
2015-04-08 05:08 <jxf> I know I can just write something easy like `ns = Enumerator.new { |y| n = 1; loop { y.yield n; n += 1 } }` but I don't want to sprinkle that all over the place
2015-04-08 05:08 <Radar> jxf: Depends on if there's an upper limit to that number.
2015-04-08 05:08 <jxf> Radar: There is not. That's why I want it to be lazy.

2015-04-08 09:48 <canton7> saying the other camp has merits (even though I belong to this camp through and through) shouldn't be regarded as unusual :P
2015-04-08 09:48 <pipework> canton7: I don't personally buy into that entirely. But assuming it's true, your response was not one that aligns with your stated purpose.
2015-04-08 09:48 <pipework> <canton7>	 someone who isn't a blind fanboi? ;)
2015-04-08 09:48 <pipework> Not a defusing statement, miaow is it?
2015-04-08 09:48 <canton7> that was being playful :P

2015-04-08 09:49 <pipework> You can make excuses if you like.
2015-04-08 09:49 <jhass> kq_away_: ah well, 1.8 is long dead ;)
2015-04-08 09:49 <pipework> But I find your position to be dishonest and inconsistent, ruining your argument.
2015-04-08 09:49 <canton7> chill out :)
2015-04-08 09:49 <pipework> The merit of it.
2015-04-08 09:49 <toertore> programming arguments are a zero sum game - one side has to win, and you better make sure it's yours
2015-04-08 09:49 <canton7> I'm not trying to make an argument

2015-04-08 09:49 <toertore> the end justifies the means
2015-04-08 09:49 <canton7> I don't want this to be a war, and I'm not trying to fight anyone
2015-04-08 09:50 <canton7> let's just all calm down :)

2015-04-08 09:50 <workmad3> canton7: humans are psychologically inclined to boost the merits of the camp they agree with and discount the merits of the camp they disagree with... so yes, it should be regarded as unusual for you to espouse the merits, but not because you're wrong ;)

2015-04-08 09:52 <kq_away_> jhass: well, the bot relies on it being available and I recall having problems on newer ruby versions. I'm sure they're not insurmountable but it's not supported anymore so I'd have to fix everything myself. As it is now, it's a legacy system that works well
2015-04-08 09:53 <pipework> canton7: Agreed. Your observation, since it didn't have a point, was valid.
2015-04-08 09:53 <canton7> workmad3, among my colleagues, balance in a discussion isn't unusual. I always forget that IRC is somewhat more polarised!
2015-04-08 09:53 <pipework> livcd: Go look up the box model if you haven't already studied it.
2015-04-08 09:53 <jhass> kq_away_: sure, just be aware that advice here and security patches by the ruby devs will not apply to that version anymore. It's out of support
2015-04-08 09:53 <pipework> That's only the starting point though, there's some intersting stuff.
2015-04-08 09:54 <livcd> pipework: ok will do

2015-04-08 09:55 <adaedra> which I proudly ignore :>
2015-04-08 09:55 <jhass> kq_away_: all styleguides say to do it, 99% of public Ruby code is written that way

2015-04-08 09:55 <kq_away_> But I like tabs :(
2015-04-08 09:55 <canton7> yh__, completely agreed on the virtualisation. Shared hosting still has its niche though - it's getting smaller, but you can't argue that it still exists
2015-04-08 09:55 <adaedra> use tabs if you want
2015-04-08 09:55 <adaedra> we won’t send a killer if you do so
2015-04-08 09:55 <toertore> don't fuckin use tabs
2015-04-08 09:55 <pipework> It's okay to proudly ignore, especially if you don't care if you're summarily ignored.

2015-04-08 09:56 <canton7> yh__, also, if I need a quick 1-file script, I'm going to go with dropping a PHP file in some folder rather than spinning up yet another thin instance
2015-04-08 09:56 <pipework> yh__: Your observation also falls under the categorization in your observation. Self-consistent, I like that.
2015-04-08 09:56 <adaedra> just, if you do, some angry people may reject your code just for this reason.
2015-04-08 09:56 <pipework> canton7: Why's that, you know PHP better than ruby?
2015-04-08 09:56 <pipework> adaedra: Why do they have to be angry?
2015-04-08 09:56 <toertore> tabs vs spaces is one of the few areas where you just need to suck it up and do what everyone else does
2015-04-08 09:57 <pipework> Why can't they simply be enforcing community norms without any emotional involvement?
2015-04-08 09:57 <canton7> pipework, because if I didn't, I'd have 30 thin instances running by now, and I'd need to get some more RAM

2015-04-08 09:57 <mikecmpbll> github should've converted every repo to tab spacing for april fools.
2015-04-08 09:57 <pipework> canton7: Your observation has some bias and probably a lack of information that would inform that observation.

2015-04-08 09:58 <canton7> pipework, it's an observation on a particular use-case. It's a small edge-case use-case, but it's there
2015-04-08 09:58 <mikecmpbll> "we're making a stand on indentation!"
2015-04-08 09:58 <pipework> canton7: I think your approach is fundamentally flawed.
2015-04-08 09:58 <canton7> pipework, why do you think that, with no information?
2015-04-08 09:58 <toertore> mikecmpbll: "opinionated"
2015-04-08 09:58 <pipework> "I want to do a one-off script in ruby, I have to use puma!"
2015-04-08 09:58 <mikecmpbll> toertore: :D
2015-04-08 09:59 <canton7> pipework, if you've got any alternative suggestions, I'd love to hear them
2015-04-08 09:59 <pipework> canton7: Because I .trust that if you had more information you wouldn't hide it and tell me I don't know the information.
2015-04-08 09:59 <yh__> canton7: the market exists.  But the participants getting involved in it are arguably making a poor business decision/commitment.  That's why I don't think it should serve as a predicate for advocating any merit for PHP
2015-04-08 09:59 <pipework> That might be what you're doing, in which case I'm wrong, but there's something else very telling going on about the conversation.
2015-04-08 09:59 <pipework> canton7: I use ruby all the time without needing an application server.

2015-04-08 10:01 <pipework> canton7: Ah, that's a useful clarification!
2015-04-08 10:01 <canton7> ok, maybe I didn't make it clear enough that I'm talking about web stuff :P
2015-04-08 10:01 <mikecmpbll> ok then. pipework : i think he's talking about web apps

2015-04-08 10:03 <toertore> canton7: what he's trying to say is that if you know what you're doing, what programming language you use matters very little
2015-04-08 10:03 <canton7> pipework, I'm not worried about speed. If I want to make a little api server, which is called maybe twice a day and totals 200 lines, spinning up an always-present app server is a bit of a waste

2015-04-08 10:09 <canton7> mikecmpbll, is there a fastcgi server that can host multiple rube apps?
2015-04-08 10:09 <canton7> pipework, nah, that's not a concern here
2015-04-08 10:09 <jhass> Tomasso: why not call .min?
2015-04-08 10:09 <canton7> s/rube/ruby/
2015-04-08 10:09 <Tomasso> well.. <= should be.. but anyway
2015-04-08 10:09 agrinb has quit [Ping timeout: 245 seconds]
2015-04-08 10:10 <pipework> canton7: So you'd basically have your rack app that, based on whatever value you want to switch on, like param string, would either call into some code in the current process's runtime, or delegate to a new process or delegate to a running process.
2015-04-08 10:10 <jhass> Tomasso: not that you can also pass a block to min and there's min_by
2015-04-08 10:10 <toertore> canton7: so cgi just calls a program, sends it input and receives output, it can be anything
2015-04-08 10:10 <pipework> However, it sounds like the running process isn't good.
2015-04-08 10:10 <jhass> *note
2015-04-08 10:10 <Tomasso> mm .min  .. .
2015-04-08 10:10 <mikecmpbll> Tomasso: :D
2015-04-08 10:10 <pipework> And the first one isn't good either because you'd have to keep that stuff loaded into the runtime and that sounds like something you want to avoid.
2015-04-08 10:10 <canton7> toertore, cgi is out: nginx doesn't like it :P
2015-04-08 10:10 <Tomasso> well.. thats more intuitive
2015-04-08 10:11 <pipework> canton7: In short, use puma with a rack app that uses subprocesses.
2015-04-08 10:11 <canton7> pipework, yeah - I tried making some rack middleware which forked when a new app was needed, then unloaded afterwards. But I couldn't get it to unload properly
2015-04-08 10:11 <pipework> That way the memory can be reclaimed or reallocated for everything.
2015-04-08 10:11 chinmay_dd has quit [Ping timeout: 276 seconds]
2015-04-08 10:12 <pipework> I wouldn't fork, but that's because I think a fresh new process would limit the memory bloat, but maybe someone knows off hand about CoW support.
2015-04-08 10:12 <canton7> yeah, that might have been where I was going wrong
2015-04-08 10:12 <toertore> basically, your very own cgi server :P

2015-04-08 10:13 <pipework> toertore: Yeah, sorta. Like CGI with a routing layer on top.
2015-04-08 10:13 <pipework> Instead of routing in the CGI script
2015-04-08 10:13 <canton7> I got as far as this, but it never really worked out : https://github.com/canton7/rack-multisite

2015-04-08 10:13 <toertore> well, that's what e.g. apache does too

2015-04-08 10:14 <pipework> canton7: One more suggestion is to figure out how to not create even the string in ruby that you will end up writing to the response.

2015-04-08 10:14 <mikecmpbll> handles multiple apps

2015-04-08 10:14 lanemeyer has joined #ruby
2015-04-08 10:14 <canton7> mikecmpbll, iirc it swallows more memory for each app, and doesn't unload them?
2015-04-08 10:14 <canton7> or at least, last time I tried - which was a few years ago
2015-04-08 10:14 <mikecmpbll> canton7: no, it shuts down app processes all the time
2015-04-08 10:15 <mikecmpbll> you can configure it however
2015-04-08 10:15 <pipework> If the process can be responsible for providing either a fully valid http response to shove down the socket, or you could actually do something fundamentally different where you use ephemeral ports and pass those sockets or references to them into the subprocess.
2015-04-08 10:15 <canton7> maybe I'm mis-remembering
2015-04-08 10:15 <mikecmpbll> canton7: sounds like it.
2015-04-08 10:15 <toertore> canton7: though to be completely honest, most of the time you won't want to be dealing with the details and edge cases of running processes and parsing http yourself, which is what php does for you
2015-04-08 10:15 <canton7> yeah - I was mainly wondering whether someone else had solved this problem in a way I wasn't aware of
2015-04-08 10:16 <toertore> but with a rack server you could send the parsed http as json
2015-04-08 10:16 <pipework> toertore: I don't know, it depends on exactly how much he wants to optimize.
2015-04-08 10:16 <pipework> He could start inneffficient and keep moving down.
2015-04-08 10:16 <toertore> sure
2015-04-08 10:16 <canton7> since some of this stuff won't be called for possibly months on end, I ideally want zero overhead
2015-04-08 10:16 <toertore> the way mongrel2 does things is interesting, but that requires a long running process

2015-04-08 10:19 <pipework> By doing that you ought to end up with a system that, at worst, uses the same amount of memory (maybe with a little overhead), but no more to service the same requests.
2015-04-08 10:19 fabrice31 has joined #ruby
2015-04-08 10:19 <pipework> At best, it probably floats around a consistent amount of memory 'pressure' or usage at any given time.

2015-04-08 14:49 <bradland> granted that in the example given, the proportion of time required to validate the contract is high relative to the actual work being done (adding two ints)
2015-04-08 14:50 <bradland> but based on this, i'd avoid contracts where performance is important
2015-04-08 14:50 <aawe> is something like this possible? https://gist.github.com/awestroke/b2600f5360ab75621de4
2015-04-08 14:51 <workmad3> bradland: or use them on the public interface of a library and not internally, so that you can enforce data coming in
2015-04-08 14:51 <bradland> yeah, use when appropriate, rather than everywhere
2015-04-08 14:51 <bradland> the IO example the author uses at the end kind of leaves a bad taste in my mouth too.
2015-04-08 14:52 <bradland> int + int is about as fast as you can get, while IO.read is about as slow as you can get
2015-04-08 14:52 <bradland> i guess the truth is that you'd have to test it in your code to know what the impact is

2015-04-08 16:05 <kq_away_> jhass: but CLR and jvm are also vms
2015-04-08 16:05 <workmad3> jhass: you can JIT with a VM... in that setup, the VM bytecode would be generated when loading the source, and then when a particular method is going to be executed for the first time, it's run through a JIT compiler that turns the VM bytecode into native code. That native code could then be kept around for the rest of the program run-time to speed up execution
2015-04-08 16:05 <workmad3> jhass: in fact, I'm not sure of any JIT setup that doesn't function on a VM in practice :P

2015-04-08 16:14 <workmad3> partition is one of those methods that you forget about because you never use it... and then you hit a problem where it's absolutely perfect ;)

2015-04-08 19:44 <User458764> I think I will do a test condition and to check if it is upcase or downcase

2015-04-08 21:32 <ProteusX> I have two questions about gem publishing: 1. When extending core classes with your own methods, is it standard practice to check for a method clash? 2. I am working on something that does natural language processing, and as such I need to store the irregularties. Is it unheard of for a gem to include its own database file?

2015-04-08 21:37 <_cgcardona_> Hi, i have an array of a bunch of strings which are zip codes.
2015-04-08 21:37 <_cgcardona_> I'm looping over that array w/ `.each` and calling a webservice which is returning ultimately a large hash.
2015-04-08 21:37 <_cgcardona_> I'm running this on resque and i've noticed the memory ballooning up.
2015-04-08 21:37 <_cgcardona_> I'd like to clear out the memory of the hash on each loop. I've tried data_hash.clear and data_hash = nil
2015-04-08 21:37 <_cgcardona_> Here is a basic code example: http://pastebin.com/NTJunuAy

2015-04-08 22:37 <ClosedGL> Hi folks, not sure if this is the right place to enquire, but is anyone else having problems with rubydocs (yard) not re-generating?
2015-04-08 22:38 <Mon_Ouie> Well, byte is byte in French too -- and octet is octet in English
2015-04-08 22:38 <Mon_Ouie> It's just the word people use in everyday speech in French is always octet, while in English people always use byte
