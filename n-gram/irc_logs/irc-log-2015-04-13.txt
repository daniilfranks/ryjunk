2015-04-13 00:25 <weaksauce> http://pastebin.com/dvb8qwMB
2015-04-13 00:25 <ruboto> weaksauce, we in #ruby do not like pastebin.com, I reposted your paste to gist for you: https://gist.github.com/4b3d5d8ca0d19f3768b9
2015-04-13 00:25 <ruboto> pastebin.com loads slowly for most, has ads which are distracting and has terrible formatting.
2015-04-13 00:25 <weaksauce> nope
2015-04-13 00:25 <Radar> Yeah, it doesn't.
2015-04-13 00:26 <dodobrain> out of curiosity, how do you paste multiple files in a gist ?
2015-04-13 00:26 <dodobrain> i've never done it myself
2015-04-13 00:26 <weaksauce> add new file button
2015-04-13 00:26 <sevenseacat> how do so many people miss that button?

2015-04-13 00:30 <Radar> And yeah, I think it's because it's in the bottom left too. People read diagonally from top left -> bottom right
2015-04-13 00:30 <Radar> and add file should probably be a different colour to draw people's attention ot it

2015-04-13 00:31 <mozzarella> also, it's text, should be an icon instead
2015-04-13 00:32 <dodobrain> it should be "+ file" with a different bg colour

2015-04-13 00:34 <Radar> People will still miss it
2015-04-13 00:34 <Radar> Nobody changes those settings up the top
2015-04-13 00:34 <sevenseacat> and it should be blinking
2015-04-13 00:34 <Radar> they try to format it using like "------" or whatever and they miss it

2015-04-13 01:11 <dodobrain> i assume it is a reference called 'name' to an object, is that correct? if yes, where would you use :name instead of @name to refer to an instance variable?

2015-04-13 01:14 <drocsid> dodobrain: Sounds like you are pretty familiar with another language, but less so with ruby. Maybe this will help: https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/ruby-from-other-languages/
2015-04-13 01:14 <drocsid> dodobrain: I think there is a rails channel somewhere.
2015-04-13 01:14 <drocsid> try #rails or something like that.

2015-04-13 01:16 <drocsid> Then that's probably a good place for ror specific stuff.
2015-04-13 01:17 <dodobrain> anyway, back to my original question; i saw in the 20 min tutorial 'attr_accessor :instance_var' would this work with 'attr_accessor @instance_var'  as well?
2015-04-13 01:17 <dodobrain> or is @instance_var returning the value of the var?

2015-04-13 09:13 <wasamasa> its docs are minimal, but it works
2015-04-13 09:13 <canton7> slop or trollop for me
2015-04-13 09:13 jenrzzz has quit [Ping timeout: 248 seconds]
2015-04-13 09:13 <ytti> yeah i might need to fall back to trollop
2015-04-13 09:14 <ytti> just to avoid complications with pry
2015-04-13 09:14 <wasamasa> what complications?
2015-04-13 09:14 <jhass> so you already have code in your comments, can just do everything that way at that point
2015-04-13 09:14 universa1 is now known as universal
2015-04-13 09:14 universal is now known as universa1
2015-04-13 09:14 <ytti> wasamasa, you cannot run two versions of library at the time
2015-04-13 09:14 <ytti> wasamasa, so if you use slop 4.0, you cannot pry that code

2015-04-13 09:14 <wasamasa> wat
2015-04-13 09:14 <ytti> arguably pry could be separated to pry-lib and pry-cli
2015-04-13 09:15 <shevy> wasamasa seems confused
2015-04-13 09:15 <ytti> where pry-lib wouldn't depend on slop, and you could do require 'pry' without complications
2015-04-13 09:15 <wasamasa> oh, pry depends on slop
2015-04-13 09:15 <wasamasa> well, that explains it then

2015-04-13 09:17 <jhass> that was what my snippet illustrated, yes
2015-04-13 09:17 <mark06> does ruby have/plan something like python's docstrings?
2015-04-13 09:18 <wasamasa> nope
2015-04-13 09:18 <wasamasa> there is a docstring gem though
2015-04-13 09:18 <wasamasa> and tools like yard which parse comments to generate documentation from that
2015-04-13 09:19 <ytti> i wish github would generate purty document pages for projects which use common document engine formats
2015-04-13 09:19 <ytti> would motivate me document my crap better
2015-04-13 09:19 <mark06> wasamasa, jhass: yes easyoptions is about parsing help text like docopt, initially from comments but I plan to allow for strings

2015-04-13 09:25 <undeadaedra> yeah, true
2015-04-13 09:25 <undeadaedra> submit them the idea then
2015-04-13 09:25 <ytti> i suspect i'm not only one, who would be motivated to document better, if pretty presentation would appear in github like magic
2015-04-13 09:25 <ytti> funnily enough, for the social coding site github presents itself, they don't offer any user2github communication channel
2015-04-13 09:26 <ytti> or not social channel anyhow, there is feedback form

2015-04-13 09:28 <jhass> and the upvoting no longer works because nobody cares to search for existing ideas and reposts the same stuff over and over again instead

2015-04-13 09:33 <Darkwater> jhass: how about a list of instances?
2015-04-13 09:34 <canton7> sounds like a memory leak
2015-04-13 09:34 <Darkwater> how so?
2015-04-13 09:34 <jhass> class level instance var
2015-04-13 09:34 <jhass> you don't need the much broader scope of @@vars for that
2015-04-13 09:35 <canton7> depends on the application of course. but stopping all instances ever created from being collected is typically considered a memory leak :P
2015-04-13 09:35 <Darkwater> though @vars are per instance, right?
2015-04-13 09:35 <jhass> yes, and your class definition is an instance of the class Class
2015-04-13 09:36 <Darkwater> hm, I think I see what you're getting at
2015-04-13 09:36 <Darkwater> reminds me of how you can call functions in a class definition

2015-04-13 09:38 <jhass> as said, I'd use a class level instance var
2015-04-13 09:39 <Darkwater> what's that? @var?
2015-04-13 09:39 <jhass> yes
2015-04-13 09:39 <Darkwater> wait, that's just the instance var part, right? what's class level?
2015-04-13 09:39 <jhass> class MySingleton; def self.instance; @instance ||= new; end; end;
2015-04-13 09:39 <Darkwater> I think I'm misunderstanding that part
2015-04-13 09:40 <Darkwater> isn't that just for one instance?
2015-04-13 09:40 <clarkk> apeiros: I had read that, which is how I constructed the command above. I've obviously missed something. Can you help?

2015-04-13 12:04 <DaniG2k> I did it in ruby 1.9.5

2015-04-13 12:07 <DaniG2k> in Japan
2015-04-13 12:07 <DaniG2k> and as i speak Japanese they thought I'd be a good candidate
2015-04-13 12:07 <kubunto> a website?
2015-04-13 12:07 <DaniG2k> but the test website was such shit
2015-04-13 12:07 <DaniG2k> like, from the 80s or something
2015-04-13 12:08 <DaniG2k> kubunto: http://www.indeed.co.uk/
2015-04-13 12:08 <kubunto> ah
2015-04-13 12:08 <DaniG2k> it was for that company, but in Japan
2015-04-13 12:08 <DaniG2k> which would have been awesome
2015-04-13 12:08 <DaniG2k> but apparently they're freaking nuts
2015-04-13 12:08 <DaniG2k> the second question was harder
2015-04-13 12:08 <kubunto> well it make a little sense they want things fast
2015-04-13 12:09 <DaniG2k> took me so long to get to the end at at the very last part I got the operations order backwards and failed :\

2015-04-13 12:13 <DaniG2k> apeiros: no, 2 seconds in no matter what language. dumb eh? the order would be given with a sequence of gets that I needed to implement. So the first like would be an integer, like 5, which means that I need to gets the next 5 lines which will give me the ordering of the balls
2015-04-13 12:13 <DaniG2k> apeiros: that took me 15 mins

2015-04-13 12:13 <DaniG2k> then I realized the next step was, they would also ask this for an integer k, the number of times it happens
2015-04-13 12:13 <DaniG2k> which is like 100,000,000
2015-04-13 12:13 <DaniG2k> and that just took longer than 2 seconds

2015-04-13 12:40 <zlude> jhass, like.. I'm using hashes in top version, and it don't work in 1.9.2
2015-04-13 12:41 <jhass> 1.9 is EOL, not sure why you care about it
2015-04-13 12:41 <hanmac1> imo keyargs are more useful when you have more than ones like 3+ or something

2015-04-13 13:29 <SirFunk> Is there some way in ruby to pass a class along with some context into a method so that when the method does .new on the class it has some custom context?
2015-04-13 13:29 <SirFunk> kind of like .bind in javascript?

2015-04-13 15:05 <dudedudeman> well, does it work when you run it?
2015-04-13 15:05 <ninjs> the problem is I'm not done with what I want it to do yet. I guess I should just print x,y, z. Haha thanks
2015-04-13 15:05 <DaniG2k> ninjs: is y always at position 6 in the row and z always at position 24?

2015-04-13 15:06 <DaniG2k> ninjs: instead of assigning it a statically typed number
2015-04-13 15:06 <ninjs> DaniG2k: Yeah. So this program spits out this excel file with the data always in the same spot, one file per row. I need to parse through those rows, grab and format some of the data in each cell, and spit out about 6 cells per row on a new document

2015-04-13 15:23 <ninjs> I can instantiate the new file in a variable..
2015-04-13 15:23 <ismaelga> Hi everyone!
2015-04-13 15:24 <ismaelga> Do you guys know any tool that for a list of words, generates one big, but minified regex that only matches those words?
2015-04-13 15:24 <jhass> ismaelga: "minified"?

2015-04-13 15:27 <dudedudeman> ninjs: are you using Ruby's File class and IO class?
2015-04-13 15:27 <ismaelga> jhass: The use case for this would be to check if some kind of identifier is in a list. But I rather store a regex instead of a huge list
2015-04-13 15:27 <ninjs> Okay so here's that I'm trying to do: Iterate over that loop I posted, grab the values from each of those cells, and put them into a new file to be written.
2015-04-13 15:28 <ninjs> dudedudeman: Not that I know of? haha

2015-04-13 15:29 <ismaelga> jhass: google doesn't help much either. It only returns stuff about regexps for minifying html, css, etc... :/

2015-04-13 15:41 <Mon_Ouie> ismaelga: I doubt you could do that efficiently, one can't even efficiently find an NFA with a minimal amount of states and a regexp is basically that (and Ruby's regexps are actually more powerful than that, but I imagine you're not going to need those extra features)

2015-04-13 16:52 <Mon_Ouie> Probably failed because ruboto isn't an op on this channel?

2015-04-13 18:23 <C-Otto> I'd like to copy the error messages collected during ActiveRecord validation, and append them to the error messages of another object.
2015-04-13 18:23 <C-Otto>       exception.record.errors.each { |key| exception.record.errors[key].each { |value| @todo.errors[key] << value } }
2015-04-13 18:23 <C-Otto> this is my current attempt, which a) is ugly b) somehow does not terminate certain cases, could you enlighten me?

2015-04-13 19:17 <ytti> work_op, 'moi' and 'moi' have different object_id but same hash
2015-04-13 19:17 <work_op> i see
2015-04-13 19:17 <jhass> >> ["foo".hash, "foo".hash, "foo".object_id, "foo".object_id] # work_op
2015-04-13 19:17 <ruboto> jhass # => [564976639, 564976639, 544003120, 544004030] (https://eval.in/313014)
2015-04-13 19:17 <hanmac> work_op: also object_id is implementation/runtime specific, while hash is content specific

2015-04-13 19:17 <kq_away_> okay
2015-04-13 19:17 <work_op> so an object will retain the same id, but its hash could change over time, right?

2015-04-13 19:17 <jhass> well, hash is not stable across ruby processes
2015-04-13 19:17 <work_op> if its values are modified

2015-04-13 19:19 <hanmac> work_op: about implementation specific, there is FLONUM which does gives Float numbers fixed object Ids under 64 bit, (and also does move some other ids around) so you may never depend on specific object ids

2015-04-13 19:22 <baweaver> also 8 space indentation is a bit severe, most people tend to use 2 in Ruby.
2015-04-13 19:22 <baweaver> 4 in Python

2015-04-13 19:23 <baweaver> might want to translate that to spaces.

2015-04-13 19:24 <hanmac> imo i also use tabs in some of my projects because it does makes more sense for me (and most of my programs does handle them better)

2015-04-13 19:25 <baweaver> because at least in the case of Rubymine, Vim, and Sublime spaces are perfectly usable, and that's most of the ruby community right there.

2015-04-13 22:12 <jhass> ninjs: why don't you open the target file above and add the rows to it in the .each loop?
2015-04-13 22:12 <chintanparikh> if I have every field for a TCP header (http://www.thebryantadvantage.com/images/TCP%20Header.jpg) in an array and I want to turn it into the actual header string using Array.pack, how would I do that?
2015-04-13 22:13 astrobunny has quit [Remote host closed the connection]
2015-04-13 22:13 <chintanparikh> I guess a better question is I have certain values in an array and I want to fit them in a string so they only take up a certian amount of bytes
2015-04-13 22:13 <ninjs> how do I do an each loop in the .each loop? if that makes sense
2015-04-13 22:13 <jhass> chintanparikh: you would read for example the RFC for the wire format and pass a format string to pack that matches it
2015-04-13 22:13 <ninjs> jhass: the rows should be 1:1. So read from row 1, print in row 1
2015-04-13 22:13 <jhass> ninjs: why would you need to?
2015-04-13 22:14 <ninjs> So I could do something like...
2015-04-13 22:14 <havenwood> FernandoBasso: I prefer `arr.first`, just a method, to `arr[0]`, a method with an argument--unless it's for aesthetic uniformity.
2015-04-13 22:14 <chintanparikh> jhass: Think you could help me figure out the format string? My actual header is a little different from the TCP header but I can't figure out the format string

2015-04-13 23:22 <maletor> to_i
2015-04-13 23:23 <zachrab> that converts "17,000.04" to 17 not 17,000.04
2015-04-13 23:23 <dodobrain> no.. to_i will drop the decimals no?

2015-04-13 23:23 <zachrab> ruboto: whats the most efficient way if the commas there and i need the decimal values
2015-04-13 23:23 <maletor> you probably have to remove non digits first zachrab
2015-04-13 23:23 <centrx> to_i only drops non-numeric characters at the end
