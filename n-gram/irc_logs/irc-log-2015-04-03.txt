2015-04-03 01:35 <jhass> db connection happens on initialization, so this has actually nothing to do with rspec I'd say

2015-04-03 09:30 <Deathcode> lol
2015-04-03 09:30 <hectortrope> first they laugh at noobs then they realise noobs are not noobs anymore then they are inspired of them for their achievements :-)

2015-04-03 09:33 <hectortrope> Deathcode:  go to java channel
2015-04-03 09:33 <adaedra> I think most of us here don’t give a f*ck about your java skills, actually
2015-04-03 09:33 <Deathcode> adaedra:well at least you can understand. that sentence had a lot of bad grammar and spelling on there
2015-04-03 09:33 <hectortrope> Deathcode: /JOIN # java
2015-04-03 09:33 <Deathcode> hectortrope:yeah they are too boring. plus i'm learning ruby now
2015-04-03 09:34 <Deathcode> so i come to this channel for help
2015-04-03 09:34 <adaedra> Which is ok
2015-04-03 09:34 <adaedra> But don’t come with your questionning about Java here
2015-04-03 09:34 <hectortrope> Deathcode: Java = so many Jobs ruby = only few jobs
2015-04-03 09:34 <Deathcode> no i wasnt talking about java when i said off topic question

2015-04-03 09:35 <Deathcode> so much drama
2015-04-03 09:35 <Deathcode> what criticism
2015-04-03 09:35 <Deathcode> i was agreeing lmao
2015-04-03 09:35 <Deathcode> go read up
2015-04-03 09:35 <Deathcode> what?
2015-04-03 09:36 <Deathcode> anyway my question was
2015-04-03 09:36 <Deathcode> i want to use ruby to parse a webpage to get music data from there like music album name, artist etc
2015-04-03 09:36 <Deathcode> can ruby be used to parse html?
2015-04-03 09:36 <adaedra> yes, you have libraries for that
2015-04-03 09:37 Aswebb_ has quit [Remote host closed the connection]
2015-04-03 09:37 <adaedra> nokogiri is the most known
2015-04-03 09:37 <Deathcode> like something that will look at the html and return the music artist name and stuff off of the html and put it as a string and give it to me
2015-04-03 09:37 <adaedra> it will parse the html
2015-04-03 09:37 <sandelius> Deathcode Nokiri allows you to "query" the document
2015-04-03 09:37 <jhass> Deathcode: research nokogiri, css, xpath
2015-04-03 09:37 <adaedra> you’ll have to navigate through the DOM
2015-04-03 09:37 <grug> hectortrope: he's banned from ##Java :P
2015-04-03 09:38 <Deathcode> ah i see

2015-04-03 09:38 <Deathcode> is there a super accurate music database that you guys know of? (that was my offtopic question)
2015-04-03 09:39 RegulationD has joined #ruby
2015-04-03 09:39 <Deathcode> that will put the artist name and music title separately, cause i looked everywhere
2015-04-03 09:39 parduse has joined #ruby
2015-04-03 09:39 <Deathcode> and like, i want the html parsing to parse at one line specifically for every search
2015-04-03 09:39 <Deathcode> is there a line locator thing on html parsing?
2015-04-03 09:39 milesmatthias has quit [Ping timeout: 252 seconds]
2015-04-03 09:39 <adaedra> You know, if you want a music database, you may want to look for one that has a separate API
2015-04-03 09:39 <adaedra> so you don’t have to parse HTML at all
2015-04-03 09:40 <adaedra> and don’t risk breaking site rules
2015-04-03 09:40 <Deathcode> ahhh
2015-04-03 09:40 <Deathcode> good advice. i like that :)

2015-04-03 10:43 <hectortrope> Hi guys I have a doubt does ruby the hardway book by zed shaw realkly good??
2015-04-03 10:43 yxhuvud has joined #ruby
2015-04-03 10:44 <Elite6809> what?
2015-04-03 10:44 <jhass> hectortrope: the style is fine if you can cope for it, the ruby is largely unidiomatic though, IMO
2015-04-03 10:45 <jhass> at least by todays standards
2015-04-03 10:45 <hectortrope> U mean u ike that ook or no?? Atleast for learning dsl
2015-04-03 10:46 <hectortrope> domain specific language of ruby that book enough?
2015-04-03 10:46 <jhass> that question doesn't make too much sense
2015-04-03 10:46 <jhass> stat by learning what a DSL is
2015-04-03 10:46 <hectortrope> U answer something with sense plz
2015-04-03 10:47 <jhass> apeiros: mh, u is not free as a nick either I guess, sad
2015-04-03 10:47 <hectortrope> ruby and dsl ruby so different?
2015-04-03 10:47 <apeiros> jhass: too bad
2015-04-03 10:47 <jhass> hectortrope: again, that question contains assertions that are wrong

2015-04-03 10:51 <apeiros> a) the complexity of your API increases geometrically, b) the expectation on what your API will accept go up, making changes much more difficult
2015-04-03 10:52 <apeiros> and in human interaction, if you don't feed back how input is understood, it'll lead to frustration, à la "what? why does it do that? that's not what I meant".

2015-04-03 12:01 <djellemah_> netroby: ruby has stong encapsulation, so everything's a method call. And where a method lives can change at runtime. So there are many optimisations that a JIT can't do.

2015-04-03 12:10 <djellemah_> netroby: use processes with fork. JRuby and Rubinius both have no GIL.
2015-04-03 12:10 <jhass> ytti: it's potentially ambiguous to the / operator, same for &foo

2015-04-03 13:55 <adaedra> anil_: now do some projects in ruby
2015-04-03 13:56 <adaedra> it’s by using it that you’ll know if you are good

2015-04-03 14:00 <anil_> what is chef?

2015-04-03 14:35 <Nilium> I believe that people choose what they remember, and most people learn about MySQL before anything else, which would help to explain why it's now in place without considering other options

2015-04-03 16:31 <willharrison> I used the !~ because I saw a stack overflow answer that said it was more efficient
2015-04-03 16:32 <jhass> mh I guess your regex actually works, damn double negation :P

2015-04-03 16:33 <willharrison> but !~ /\d/ read easier to me
2015-04-03 16:34 <willharrison> I read it as 'if not a number'
2015-04-03 16:34 <jhass> mh, I generalized that in my thinking too far I guess
2015-04-03 16:34 <jhass> I read it as "matches any number, not that"

2015-04-03 17:16 <jhass> the convention for both, new and a method named after a class is to return an instance of that class though

2015-04-03 17:25 <djellemah> willharrison: it looks to me that you're not clear on what you want to do with KaraInt. Maybe if you thought about it from that point of view, the internals would be clearer? eg...
2015-04-03 17:25 <pagios> jhass: like they are using s3 = Aws::S3::Client.new i want to use SNS what would be the format for example
2015-04-03 17:25 <willharrison> djellemah what do you mean?
2015-04-03 17:26 <djellemah> What code would you use to call it: maybe 'KaraInt.new("5").valid?'
2015-04-03 17:26 <willharrison> KaraInt is just an object that can take very large numbers and add and subtract them
2015-04-03 17:26 <djellemah> willharrison: Oh, right.
2015-04-03 17:26 <willharrison> just KaraInt.new("5")

2015-04-03 20:30 <GaryOak_> If you have a class without state should it just be a module, or is there a good reason for it to be a class?
2015-04-03 20:31 teddyp1cker has joined #ruby
2015-04-03 20:32 <shadoi1> GaryOak_: if it may ever become stateful, or if it's part of some inheritance tree you want to maintain
2015-04-03 20:32 <Sou|cutter> I recently encountered a module-based system that would have benefitted greatly from inheritance :(
2015-04-03 20:32 <jhass> milesmatthias: so to summarize, turning one class into a module and maybe reconsidering how you allow symbol key access are the only design points I'd have, else are just style nitpicks and only a few minor of those :)

2015-04-03 23:50 <riceandbeans> sorry
2015-04-03 23:50 <riceandbeans> the chief reason I'm saying ERB is puppet and automation

2015-04-03 23:50 <riceandbeans> puppet natively supports ERB and can do stuff on every run

2015-04-03 23:51 <jhass> they have their own channel, don't they? :P
2015-04-03 23:51 <riceandbeans> whatever, love it, hate it, I don't care, it's better than no automation, and it pays my bills
2015-04-03 23:51 <riceandbeans> but ERB isn't a puppet issue
2015-04-03 23:51 <riceandbeans> it's Ruby
2015-04-03 23:52 <riceandbeans> if they supported HAML maybe we'd use that
