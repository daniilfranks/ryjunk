2015-04-09 01:26 <shevy> nahtnam firstly, you must use what is stored in the hash
2015-04-09 01:26 DavidDudson has joined #ruby
2015-04-09 01:26 <shevy> if you can not want to be bothered, there is HashWithIndifferentAccess or so
2015-04-09 01:26 <shevy> you could also write a wrapper method to obtain the keys you desire
2015-04-09 01:27 <shevy> def obtain(i); hash[i.to_sym]
2015-04-09 01:27 <nahtnam> Sorry, I am confused.

2015-04-09 05:58 <Nilium> hg has arguably better data structures but worse tools, worse support, worse just about everything else.
2015-04-09 05:58 <coderkevin> what about speed?
2015-04-09 05:58 <Nilium> Slower, too.
2015-04-09 05:59 <Nilium> Side-effect of it being Python.
2015-04-09 05:59 <Nilium> Whereas git is mostly C.
2015-04-09 05:59 <coderkevin> I thought it was mostly bash, haha
2015-04-09 05:59 <Nilium> No, though I believe there's some perl in there.

2015-04-09 06:01 <coderkevin> tools are a popularity problem, I would guess.

2015-04-09 06:02 <sevenseacat> i remember many years ago looking to move away from svn to a dcvs, i looked at bzr, hg, and git.... that sentence has a lot of acronyms in it

2015-04-09 06:03 <Nilium> I used a self-hosted CVS once, nuked my repo by accident, used SVN, didn't work out, then after like 5 years of doing zip backups of code I used git and it made sense, so I used that.

2015-04-09 06:03 <coderkevin> git feels pretty natural to svn users.  You get the comfortable checkout and commit options, even though they behave completely different.

2015-04-09 06:03 <Nilium> Mercurial is a lot like a strict Subversion, so I suspect that's why a lot of svn converts pick it
2015-04-09 06:03 <sevenseacat> and honestly, not having to have an svn server, huge win.
2015-04-09 06:04 Takle has joined #ruby
2015-04-09 06:04 <coderkevin> At one point in time, I actually made a bunch of python scripts around svn to make it sort of distributed.
2015-04-09 06:04 <sevenseacat> it can be tricky getting svn people used to having a staging area, though
2015-04-09 06:04 <Nilium> That was another factor for me back when I started with git, just 'cause I had no real way of hosting an svn server.
2015-04-09 06:04 <coderkevin> Where I could keep my own distro and sync it up using scripts.
2015-04-09 06:04 <Nilium> Yeah, but the stage/index is so useful
2015-04-09 06:04 <Nilium> And mercurial's lack of it drives me insane
2015-04-09 06:04 <sevenseacat> ooh that would annoy me
2015-04-09 06:05 <sevenseacat> i have to get more familiar with the options around stashing in git
2015-04-09 06:05 <Nilium> Out of all the things I can't really live without, it's probably the index, just because the ability to build a commit is extremely useful

2015-04-09 06:06 <sevenseacat> i use stashing a lot when switching between multiple branches of work
2015-04-09 06:06 <sevenseacat> and i tend to either stash too many changes, or not all of them
2015-04-09 06:06 <Nilium> I do use them, since sometimes I need to keep stuff separate, but usually I just work in master in a fork of a repo.
2015-04-09 06:06 <sevenseacat> and things get muddled
2015-04-09 06:06 <coderkevin> I used to be too, but branches are more versatile.

2015-04-09 06:07 <Nilium> It's been nice since we set up GitLab at work.
2015-04-09 06:07 <sevenseacat> my current and previous jobs both just use github
2015-04-09 06:07 <Nilium> Drastic workflow improvement for me and a few other people because now we don't have to ssh into a server to create a new repo
2015-04-09 06:07 <coderkevin> We use gerrit where I work.

2015-04-09 06:08 <Nilium> I almost went with gerrit but decided it was very un-git-like to repeatedly amend and push the same commit
2015-04-09 06:08 <Nilium> I say "I" because I'm the one who set up GitLab
2015-04-09 06:08 <coderkevin> Yeah, it's kind of strange...but lots of people squash PRs on github anyway, so isn't that basically the same thing?

2015-04-09 06:09 <Nilium> Sort of, though I've been discouraging it at work
2015-04-09 06:09 <coderkevin> I would agree.
2015-04-09 06:09 <Nilium> Better to have the commits
2015-04-09 06:09 <sevenseacat> i dont get the reasoning behind suqashinfg commits
2015-04-09 06:09 <sevenseacat> squashing even
2015-04-09 06:09 <coderkevin> tidyness of the tree?  that's about all I can come up with.
2015-04-09 06:09 <Nilium> I think it's part of the "it must always build" mentality
2015-04-09 06:09 <sevenseacat> when i bisect and blame, i want to know exactly when something happened and why
2015-04-09 06:09 <flughafen> moin sevenseacat certainty shevy
2015-04-09 06:09 <Nilium> Which I don't really subscribe to. There's releases and then there's intermediate points in history.
2015-04-09 06:09 <sevenseacat> not just 'it happened as this chunk of work'

2015-04-09 06:10 <coderkevin> At least with gerrit you deal with individual commits...nothing to squash.
2015-04-09 06:10 <Nilium> If something comes in wholly-formed, it's probably with the line "initial commit"
2015-04-09 06:10 <andrewdotnich> I don't really use squash - I do use fixup though, for fixing the mistakes as I realise them then rebasing so they never happened

2015-04-09 06:10 <Nilium> Fixup's great.
2015-04-09 06:10 * sevenseacat looks up fixup
2015-04-09 06:11 <Nilium> I don't think anyone views fixup as having the same purpose as squash, so I've never really heard of it being used the same

2015-04-09 06:11 <Nilium> fixup is basically squash in git-rebase --interactive, but it discards the commit message.
2015-04-09 06:11 <coderkevin> Oh, so fixup is just like an amend?

2015-04-09 08:15 <diegoviola> if you can redefine methods and monkeypatch pretty much anything in ruby, you can end up extending and changing the whole language pretty much, no?
2015-04-09 08:15 <diegoviola> not saying I would do that, I won't
2015-04-09 08:15 <sevenseacat> apart from its keywords, probably.

2015-04-09 08:42 <canton7> you're 'puts'-ing each word as it's encountered
2015-04-09 08:42 <canton7> 'puts' adds a newline

2015-04-09 08:43 <kq_away_> well, yeah
2015-04-09 08:43 <canton7> so his method_missing returns a string, rather than printing something

2015-04-09 11:11 <mikecmpbll> who wins? you decide.
2015-04-09 11:11 <jokke> first
2015-04-09 11:12 jefus_ has quit [Ping timeout: 276 seconds]
2015-04-09 11:12 <jokke> at least it's elegant
2015-04-09 11:12 <mikecmpbll> ok, you no longer have the power to decide
2015-04-09 11:12 <canton7> but if it's a large array, I wouldn't recommend it
2015-04-09 11:12 <mikecmpbll> :D
2015-04-09 11:12 <jokke> you'd recommend group_by?
2015-04-09 11:12 <canton7> I *think* my second one is the most efficient
2015-04-09 11:12 <canton7> since it's not creating lots of sub-arrays
2015-04-09 11:12 <hanmac> canton7: hm maybe better might be, because you dont need to all max_by for all elements
2015-04-09 11:12 <workmad3> jokke: I'd go with the group_by, yes
2015-04-09 11:12 <hanmac> >> a = [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3]; a.uniq.max_by{ |x| a.count(x) }
2015-04-09 11:12 <ruboto> hanmac # => 3 (https://eval.in/310581)
2015-04-09 11:12 <jokke> hm ok
2015-04-09 11:13 <workmad3> canton7: oh yeah, that's a more efficient bucket-sort than the group_by :)
2015-04-09 11:13 <jokke> hanmac: that's great!
2015-04-09 11:13 <jokke> because i'll have only very few different items
2015-04-09 11:13 <jokke> at least i expect that
2015-04-09 11:14 <Mon_Ouie> You don't have to iterate over the hash table you're building separately though, you can just keep track of the current maximum in a variable and change it if the value you just increased is larger than the one associated to the maximum
2015-04-09 11:14 <canton7> true
2015-04-09 11:14 <jokke> true
2015-04-09 11:14 <hanmac> workmad3: i dont know which version, but in my version you can replace group_by { |e| e } with  group_by(&:itself)
2015-04-09 11:14 <hanmac> >> a = [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3]; a.group_by(&:itself).max_by(&:last).first

2015-04-09 11:15 <mikecmpbll> itself has just blown my mind.
2015-04-09 11:16 <undeadaedra> so many ways
2015-04-09 11:16 <workmad3> hanmac: canton's point is that you can short-circuit the creation of all the subararys in a group_by by using a hash of value => count instead
2015-04-09 11:16 <undeadaedra> >> a = {}; [ 3, 1, 3, 2, 3, 2 ].each { |e| a[e] = (a[e] || 0) + 1 }; a.max_by { |k, v| v }[1]

2015-04-09 11:16 <mikecmpbll> says mine's faster tho?
2015-04-09 11:17 <undeadaedra> should also look memory wise
2015-04-09 11:17 <canton7> >> h = Hash.new(0); max_val = nil; max_count = 0; [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3].each{ |x| count = h[x] + 1; h[x] = count; if count > max_count; max_count = count; max_val = x; end }; p max_val
2015-04-09 11:17 <ruboto> canton7 # => 3 ...check link for more (https://eval.in/310585)
2015-04-09 11:17 <canton7> long and efficient :P
2015-04-09 11:17 <undeadaedra> because if the method requires copying the whole array, it's not very memory-efficient, especially for large arrays

2015-04-09 12:05 <ruboto> jhass # => [nil, nil, nil] (https://eval.in/310653)
2015-04-09 12:05 <jhass> parallel has an each method too
2015-04-09 12:06 <jhass> not sure why you call map if you don't care about the result
2015-04-09 12:06 <Oreolek> doesn't it do the same loop?
2015-04-09 12:06 <Oreolek> oh

2015-04-09 12:42 <catphish> does anybody know how to shutdown (halfclose) an ssl socket?
2015-04-09 12:43 <jhass> I have my doubts the bindings allow that
2015-04-09 12:44 <jhass> could dupe the fd and do a regular close on the original I guess
2015-04-09 12:44 <catphish> unfortunately ssl has its own shutdown procedure
2015-04-09 12:44 <catphish> you can't just close the socket, you have to send an ssl close packet
2015-04-09 12:45 <catphish> https://www.openssl.org/docs/ssl/SSL_shutdown.html - SSL_shutdown() tries to send the "close notify" shutdown alert to the peer
2015-04-09 12:45 <jhass> yeah, SSLSocket#close should do that
2015-04-09 12:45 tier has joined #ruby
2015-04-09 12:45 <jhass> so my idea would be SSLSocket#to_io -> dupe -> SSLSocket#close
2015-04-09 12:45 <catphish> ok - i'll try that, that's not documented :(
2015-04-09 12:45 <jhass> don't know if it works, just an idea
2015-04-09 12:45 <catphish> why am i duping it?
2015-04-09 12:46 <jhass> well, SSLSocket#close will also close the underlying fd
2015-04-09 12:46 <catphish> there's also sslsocket#sysclose
2015-04-09 12:46 <catphish> which does *something* but its not clear what
2015-04-09 12:47 weemsledeux has quit [Ping timeout: 252 seconds]
2015-04-09 12:47 <jhass> sysclose should be a straigth close(2) call
2015-04-09 12:47 <catphish> hmm
2015-04-09 12:47 <jhass> ah, actually not
2015-04-09 12:47 <jhass> Shuts down the SSL connection and prepares it for another connection.
2015-04-09 12:47 <jhass> so maybe exactly what you want?
2015-04-09 12:48 <jhass> if ossl_ssl_get_sync_close doesn't close the fd it looks like it
2015-04-09 12:48 <catphish> context: i'm an TLS proxy, when i get EOF from the server i'm proxying to, i want to send an EOF to my client

2015-04-09 13:29 <workmad3> djellemah: I think apeiros's point is that a thread being used by a library may raise an exception that the library knows how to handle and could have recovered from, if you'd let the exception raise from join...
2015-04-09 13:29 <apeiros> djellemah: and I didn't think of that until yet, which is why in my threaded code, I have abort_on_exception on, and make sure my threads properly deal with exceptions as to not kill my process :)

2015-04-09 17:26 <apeiros> i.e. you could implement AR's validations in a couple of lines with it (which is one reason of what I use them for)
2015-04-09 17:27 <apeiros> yes. but one of the few components which are in a separate gem.
2015-04-09 17:27 <jhass> figured
2015-04-09 17:27 <apeiros> unlike rails, I don't only do validation in models.

2015-04-09 19:34 <drocsid> jhass: maybe I'm making a poor assumption, but the response code seems to return a value in my case statment. Regarding the use of globals, should I make this a class and use "private fields" instead? Not sure if that's the proper ruby terminology?

2015-04-09 19:40 <jhass> factory method defines a way how your child classes interact with the parent class, that's a design decision
2015-04-09 19:40 <jhass> maybe it helps to clarify that design patterns are nothing static

2015-04-09 19:51 <GaryOak_> We should be asking what makes enterprise code need to look like that, and it's probably a type system

2015-04-09 19:54 <baweaver> GaryOak_: Bad news if type systems really do create a problem, Matz was talking about going static in 3.0
2015-04-09 19:55 <GaryOak_> whoa
2015-04-09 19:55 <baweaver> both have their advantages

2015-04-09 19:55 <GaryOak_> definitely
2015-04-09 19:55 <Ellis> baweaver: what does going static mean
2015-04-09 19:55 <baweaver> types aren't the problem
2015-04-09 19:55 <baweaver> static typing
2015-04-09 19:55 <baweaver> instead of dynamic.
2015-04-09 19:55 <ducklobster> Is there a way to catch a kill (Kernel#exit) from within a thread and NOT terminate the entire ruby application?
2015-04-09 19:55 <jhass> baweaver: well, rather type checks
2015-04-09 19:56 <baweaver> yeah, granted.
2015-04-09 19:56 <weaksauce> the minitest docs say that it comes with rake tasks for running the tests. but for non rails projects it complains that there is no rakefile found. adding an empty rakefile talks about how there is no test task or no default task. Are the docs wrong or am I doing something wrong?

2015-04-09 19:56 <djellemah> baweaver: where was matz talking about that?
2015-04-09 19:56 <baweaver> Look into category theory

2015-04-09 19:57 <jhass> ducklobster: I mean, just let it run out, break from the block or whatever
2015-04-09 19:57 <ducklobster> jhass: im subclassing something that calls the exit

2015-04-09 19:57 <djellemah> static typing seems to end up as a language-within-a-language.

2015-04-09 20:12 <baweaver> pagios_: it would be a good idea to look into Redis first and find out what it does.
2015-04-09 20:12 <pagios_> ok
2015-04-09 20:13 <kaleido> redis kinda is nosql
2015-04-09 20:13 <kaleido> in so much that its a key-value store
2015-04-09 20:13 <baweaver> It's a KV store in memory with atomic operations

2015-04-09 20:14 <kaleido> youd use sentinel for HA

2015-04-09 20:15 <baweaver> you'd normally persist it somehow.
2015-04-09 20:15 <kaleido> so if youre thinking longer term storing, you might look at riak

2015-04-09 20:15 <shadoi> redis sentinel is awful and loses data during partitions, see aphyr.com
2015-04-09 20:15 <pagios_> baweaver: i mainly want to store some pushnotification tokens
2015-04-09 20:15 <pagios_> thats all
2015-04-09 20:16 <pagios_> from time to time the tokens will be added there
2015-04-09 20:16 <djellemah> The best description I heard of redis: out-of-process, atomic, persistent data structure engine.
2015-04-09 20:16 <shadoi> pagios_: if speed is not an issue, then just use PStore.

2015-04-09 20:18 <shadoi> pagios_: yeah
2015-04-09 20:18 <pagios_> i dont need network access
2015-04-09 20:18 <pagios_> tokens are stored on the same server
