2015-04-05 00:06 * gkra wants to cry now
2015-04-05 00:07 <gkra> here i am about to release a new gem
2015-04-05 00:07 Limix has quit [Quit: Limix]
2015-04-05 00:07 <gkra> and *now* I discover there's already something with that name
2015-04-05 00:07 <gkra> I'd *swear* I searched before I renamed my project, too. :(

2015-04-05 00:09 <apeiros> gkra: yeah, that's annoying.
2015-04-05 00:09 <apeiros> been there too.
2015-04-05 00:09 <apeiros> didn't exist. implemented my stuff. wanted to release ~10 days later. name taken.
2015-04-05 00:09 <gkra> so my thing's called vaquero
2015-04-05 00:09 bim has quit [Remote host closed the connection]
2015-04-05 00:09 <gkra> it's at vaquero.io
2015-04-05 00:09 <gkra> got everything set up
2015-04-05 00:09 <gkra> finally back from chefconf and want to publish the gem
2015-04-05 00:09 <sweeper> yeehaw?
2015-04-05 00:10 <gkra> and oh, there's already one named "vaquero"
2015-04-05 00:10 <gkra> so I guess i rename mine "vaquero-io"?
2015-04-05 00:10 <sweeper> or pick a descriptive name instead of trying to be cool :3
2015-04-05 00:11 <gkra> it's certainly taken the wind out of my sails
2015-04-05 00:11 <sweeper> unless you've developed a gem to allow argentinian cattlemen manage low-level disk access
2015-04-05 00:11 <gkra> though that *would* be cool

2015-04-05 08:35 <ackpacket> has_many :employees, -> { joins(:address) }   Can someone explain this syntax to me?  What does the -> signify?
2015-04-05 08:35 <sevenseacat> aa lambda.
2015-04-05 08:35 <ackpacket> I thought a block was a lambda?
2015-04-05 08:35 <wasamasa> nope
2015-04-05 08:36 <wasamasa> it's a closure!
2015-04-05 08:36 <ackpacket> hmm
2015-04-05 08:36 <wasamasa> which is a lambda with an environment
2015-04-05 08:36 <ackpacket> Ah
2015-04-05 08:36 <wasamasa> you see, outside the block's context, it wouldn't work
2015-04-05 08:36 <ackpacket> kk, good with that explanation
2015-04-05 08:37 <ackpacket> I'm still troubled by poetry mode at times though
2015-04-05 08:37 <sevenseacat> poetry mode?

2015-04-05 08:38 <ackpacket> I've seen has_many :employees, :something => value, :foo => :bar
2015-04-05 08:38 <sevenseacat> thats how i would write it
2015-04-05 08:38 <ackpacket> And I take it that means has_many is a method called with 2 arguments
2015-04-05 08:38 <ackpacket> 1 is the :employee symbol, the other is a hash
2015-04-05 08:38 <ackpacket> is that right?
2015-04-05 08:38 <sevenseacat> yep.
2015-04-05 08:38 <ackpacket> then how are they calling has_many :employees, -> { joins(:address) }, if the second argument is a lambda?
2015-04-05 08:39 <sevenseacat> have you checked the api docs for has_many?

2015-04-05 08:40 <sevenseacat> http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/Associations/ClassMethods.html#method-i-has_many seems the scope is nilla ble

2015-04-05 08:41 <sevenseacat> rails probably changes the order of the params in the different cases

2015-04-05 08:41 <sevenseacat> by reassigning them around

2015-04-05 08:43 <ackpacket> So when someone does has_many :employees, :foo => :bar, :zib => :zeb,    It examines the second "thing" separated by the commas, determines it's not a lambda, and assumes I elected not to provide any scope?
2015-04-05 08:43 <sevenseacat> likely so.
2015-04-05 08:43 <sevenseacat> dig through the code if you're really determined to find out, and keep discussions in the right channels - this isnt it.

2015-04-05 08:44 <ackpacket> Sorry, thought it was a syntax issue
2015-04-05 08:44 <ackpacket> Is the "I'll try my best to make sense of whatever order you provide arguments in" a strictly rails issue?
2015-04-05 08:45 <sevenseacat> you cant provide things in any order. if you provide the options then the scope, it wont work.

2015-04-05 10:27 <nickjj> with unity mode it's like running both linux and windows at the same time
2015-04-05 10:27 <jhass> should easily take alloting 2GB to the VM
2015-04-05 10:27 <sevenseacat> DeathCode: for rails apps, you need to learn a lot more than that.
2015-04-05 10:27 <DeathCode> ye no shit
2015-04-05 10:27 <apeiros> add in css & js
2015-04-05 10:27 <nickjj> i've used both virtualbox and vmware for years, vmware's support for seamless mode/dual monitors/general "it just works" is much better

2015-04-05 11:19 <jhass> ;)
2015-04-05 11:20 <apeiros> right now all I did was generate a large regex, which is basically all words |'ed in a single regex, ordered so that longest word matches first
2015-04-05 11:20 <jhass> I think I'd like to write the pastebin.com insulter btw, any wishes for that?
2015-04-05 11:21 <apeiros> you mean what helpa did? I'd prefer it not be insulting.
2015-04-05 11:21 <jhass> eh, you know how I mean that ;P
2015-04-05 11:21 <apeiros> poor pastebin users have no idea of the wrongness of their ways…
2015-04-05 11:22 <apeiros> well, helpa's code is fine. I can link you the pull request for #ruby's addition
2015-04-05 11:22 <jhass> like do we want to change the message on a second paste, do we want to persist that across restarts, do we want to include other services
2015-04-05 11:22 <apeiros> icing on the cake would be automatic re-gisting
2015-04-05 11:22 <jhass> oh, that's an interesting idea

2015-04-05 12:22 <FernandoBasso>  -w is warnings, and K and U are about encodings, it seems.
2015-04-05 12:22 <FernandoBasso> By reading the man page it seems in my case I should set -KuU, and not just KU.

2015-04-05 12:30 <adaedra> Hi
2015-04-05 12:30 <arup_r> I have this file on top #!/usr/bin/env ruby .. still I need to run the file using `ruby <file.rb>`... why ?
2015-04-05 12:30 <adaedra> has it the executable bit?
2015-04-05 12:30 <sevenseacat> arup_r: because the file isnt marked as executable
2015-04-05 12:30 <arup_r> yes
2015-04-05 12:30 <arup_r> no I made it sevenseacat
2015-04-05 12:31 <sevenseacat> show us
2015-04-05 12:31 <FernandoBasso>  If it is executable already, do ./program.rb
2015-04-05 12:31 <adaedra> how do you try to execute it, arup_r

2015-04-05 12:32 <arup_r> adaedra: although your trick worked
2015-04-05 12:32 <FernandoBasso> Not a trick.
2015-04-05 12:32 <FernandoBasso> And because . isn't in your PATH.
2015-04-05 12:32 <adaedra> because if you want it to respond to ’program.rb’ alone, you need to have the containing folder in your PATH.
2015-04-05 12:32 <arup_r> yes yes
2015-04-05 12:32 <FernandoBasso> Do export PATH="{$PATH}:." and you can probably run it just by typing program.rb.

2015-04-05 12:33 <arup_r> thanks all
2015-04-05 12:33 <FernandoBasso> It is ${PATH}, actually, not {$PATH}.
2015-04-05 12:34 <adaedra> If you want to make it callable from everywhere, look how to make a gem of your thing
2015-04-05 12:34 <arup_r> FernandoBasso:  but your previous trick worked too
2015-04-05 12:34 <sevenseacat> theres no tricks here.
2015-04-05 12:34 <FernandoBasso> Yeah, I would just go with that first option for local testing.
2015-04-05 12:34 <arup_r> sevenseacat: I meant suggestion... ;)
2015-04-05 12:34 <FernandoBasso> Instead of messing with PATH.
2015-04-05 12:34 <adaedra> You could go with modifying PATH (But no .), but having a gem is the better solution for that.
2015-04-05 12:34 <adaedra> Since gem path is (theorically) already in $PATH.

2015-04-05 12:41 <arup_r> I read algorithms in my college life.. which is now almost 5 years... Now I forgot all the topics I read about algorithms... So I thought I'll relearn..
2015-04-05 12:42 <arup_r> As I do know only Ruby... currently.. I forgot C also.. so will it be a good idea to learn Algorithms using Ruby ?
2015-04-05 12:42 <arup_r> advices please
2015-04-05 12:43 <adaedra> Algorithms are a complex and complete topic on its own, and rarely linked to the langage

2015-04-05 13:41 Aswebb_ has joined #ruby
2015-04-05 13:41 <pie_> in my case the hashes change even if i upload the same file, so its probably time variant
2015-04-05 13:41 <pie_> well either that or it counts collisions :/

2015-04-05 13:43 <avril14th> I mean, what do you want to reverse engineering a script? :)
2015-04-05 13:43 <avril14th> +for
2015-04-05 13:43 <phale> touch $(md5sum file) < file
2015-04-05 13:44 <pie_> i want to see if i can try generating valid hashes myself, though it probably has a user id field as well, so i probably wont be able to since that is a hash as well
2015-04-05 13:44 <phale> what exactly do you want
2015-04-05 13:44 <avril14th> well indeed
2015-04-05 13:45 <phale> an upload that saves the file with its name the md5 sum of the file?
2015-04-05 13:45 <avril14th> reverse engineering of hashs / randoms / id generators is not easy
2015-04-05 13:45 <phale> that can be done with sh
2015-04-05 13:45 <avril14th> phale: the guy said it was time variant
2015-04-05 13:45 <pie_> avril14th: its not the hash itself that is the issue, its the scheme used to generate it
2015-04-05 13:45 <phale> avril14th: % pid
2015-04-05 13:45 <pie_> so basically md5(X) and i want to figure out the X
2015-04-05 13:45 <phale> you can't it's one way
2015-04-05 13:46 <pie_> well if we assume that its userid + time then i can take a valid user id, and brute force the time field
2015-04-05 13:47 <pie_> is time is seconds since epoch its easy, if its nanoseconds it takes a little longer
2015-04-05 13:47 <phale> you dont bruteforce md5
2015-04-05 13:47 <phale> you need a supercomputer
2015-04-05 13:47 <pie_> so basically i need to brute force variant fields and brute force the order
2015-04-05 13:47 <apeiros> phale: you're a decade late
2015-04-05 13:47 <phale> i am?

2015-04-05 13:47 <phale> oh :(
2015-04-05 13:47 <adaedra> md5 is known to be insecure
2015-04-05 13:48 <pie_> phale: there are 1 billion nanoseconds in a second if i know the time to second certainty there are only 1 billion values to try
2015-04-05 13:48 <phale> only

2015-04-05 13:49 <pie_> idk how fast python does md5, but if you can do 1 million in a second it takes 1000 seconds to brute the space of a second
2015-04-05 13:49 Mark-6ma has quit [Quit: -]
2015-04-05 13:49 <pie_> ofc that can take a while if you have a lot of schemes to try since that multiplies it
2015-04-05 13:50 <pie_> and you have to take latency and stuff into account so you probably have to try a several second window, also hope for small clock drift on the remote server
2015-04-05 13:51 <pie_> the bottom line is i want to restrict the hash space as much as i can, then find the scheme, after i have the scheme maybe i can generate valid hashes with good probability
2015-04-05 13:51 <pie_> its a numbers game :P

2015-04-05 13:57 <jhass> but as I just demonstrated a 16 byte long hex encoded value doesn't have to be a md5 hash
2015-04-05 13:58 <pie_> ^
2015-04-05 13:59 <apeiros> a 16 byte long hex isn't an md5 hash. md5 hash is 16byte, which is 32byte in hex.
2015-04-05 13:59 <pie_> and since on this scale a hash function should be indistinguishable from random data, there is really no way to devide
2015-04-05 13:59 <apeiros> (it may be a slice from an md5, but a slice from an md5 is not an md5)
2015-04-05 13:59 <pie_> apeiros: then just SecureRandom.hex(32)

2015-04-05 14:02 <phale> is digest/md5 the de facto way of converting a string to md5?
2015-04-05 14:04 LJT has joined #ruby
2015-04-05 14:04 <apeiros> yes
2015-04-05 14:04 <phale> okay
2015-04-05 14:05 <apeiros> it's "de facto standard" btw. ;-)
2015-04-05 14:05 <phale> strange
2015-04-05 14:05 <phale> my md5 changes every time i launch the program
2015-04-05 14:05 <phale> the md5 hash can't be different though since it's stored in a database
2015-04-05 14:06 <apeiros> "de facto" alone only means "following from the facts / as per the facts"
2015-04-05 14:06 <phale> apeiros: why does it change ??
2015-04-05 14:06 <apeiros> phale: you're - again - not providing any useful information to help you.
2015-04-05 14:06 <phale> alright
2015-04-05 14:07 <pie_> given an integer, how would you ruby guys hash it?
2015-04-05 14:07 <pie_> or does ruby handle casting it immediately
2015-04-05 14:07 <apeiros> pie_: depends on your requirements
2015-04-05 14:07 <apeiros> what do you hash it for?
2015-04-05 14:07 gusto has joined #ruby
2015-04-05 14:07 <phale> When I run my ruby program, given no arguments to it, my program will generate a MD5 hash based on the password on a constant named PASSWORD, The only problem with this is that the hash is stored in a database, and it is forbidden for it to change.
2015-04-05 14:07 <pie_> still the same scenario, ive got no clue, this would be the nanoseconds since epoch thing(i basically just multiplied seconds by a billion)
2015-04-05 14:08 <phale> It will change every time the program is run
2015-04-05 14:08 <apeiros> phale: make a minimal code example demonstrating your problem
2015-04-05 14:08 <apeiros> phale: and put that code example on gist.github.com

2015-04-05 14:09 <phale> that's erratic
2015-04-05 14:09 <adaedra> so it’s not what you’re doing.

2015-04-05 14:11 <apeiros> pie_: so you have a black box where you provide input and the box generates a (presumably md5) hash from your input and returns that?

2015-04-05 14:12 * pie_ scratches head
2015-04-05 14:12 <apeiros> the amount of time you'd have to spend to rule db ID and time out is significant. and if you rule them out you end up with RNG which you're unlikely to be able to predict.
2015-04-05 14:12 <phale> I mean this program could be correct and i'm thinking incorrectly.

2015-04-05 15:38 <sevenseacat> prolog did my brain in at uni
2015-04-05 15:39 <apeiros> yeah, I found it quite annoying too :)
2015-04-05 15:39 <apeiros> has its bright sides, though.
2015-04-05 15:39 <apeiros> but I'm a control freak, so I don't like declarative programming.
2015-04-05 15:39 <sevenseacat> then again, everything did my brain in at uni
2015-04-05 15:39 <chridal> It is definitely uncomfortable, being a control freak myself.
2015-04-05 15:39 <phale> i love data-driven programming

2015-04-05 15:41 <sevenseacat> i did c, hated it... did java, hated it... did prolog, hated it.... actually the little bit of haskell i did was fun
2015-04-05 15:41 <chridal> sevenseacat: Why did you hate C, if I may ask?
2015-04-05 15:41 <sevenseacat> two words - memory management
2015-04-05 15:41 <chridal> two letters - ok
2015-04-05 15:41 <chridal> :-)

2015-04-05 15:42 <ytti> pure functional languages seem hard time breaking into commercial world as well as being your go-to language
2015-04-05 15:42 <ytti> i know there are opposite datapoints, but those seen minority
2015-04-05 15:42 hanmac has quit [Ping timeout: 265 seconds]
2015-04-05 15:42 <ytti> the code probably would be less buggy in pure functional language
2015-04-05 15:42 <chridal> Yes I was actually about to get into haskell, clojure or the likes, but it doesn't seem like it has been embraced too much by the commercial world yet
2015-04-05 15:43 <phale> you hated C?
2015-04-05 15:43 <phale> what the hell
2015-04-05 15:43 <phale> memory management doesn't even occur a lot when it comes to C unless you're programming in the wrong way

2015-04-05 15:44 <ytti> producing secure and bug-free C code seeems almost impossible to humans
2015-04-05 15:44 <ytti> i see people lot smarter than me failing at it constantly
2015-04-05 15:44 <ytti> so i don't feel motivated even to put effort in it
2015-04-05 15:45 <adaedra> bug-free code seems impossible in every language
2015-04-05 15:45 <phale> are you talking about memory allocation
2015-04-05 15:45 <adaedra> that’s why we have things like testing

2015-04-05 15:45 <ytti> i hope rust to become the next systems programming language

2015-04-05 15:45 <sevenseacat> i have zero desire to go back to low-level programming
2015-04-05 15:45 <phale> ytti: nice meme

2015-04-05 15:47 <adaedra> it can do what C can do.

2015-04-05 15:47 <ytti> while i see it more competitor to C++ than C, I still think it could replace C
2015-04-05 15:47 <sevenseacat> i thought go was supposed to be the next great low-level thing

2015-04-05 15:47 <ytti> nah
2015-04-05 15:48 <chridal> That sounds really beautiful to me. If Rust is seen as a competitor to C++, but can replace C.
2015-04-05 15:48 <ytti> go has great ecosystem, good libraries, good community
2015-04-05 15:48 <chridal> but?
2015-04-05 15:48 <phale> let's get this straight, you hated java and C but loved haskell?
2015-04-05 15:48 <sevenseacat> yep.
2015-04-05 15:48 <phale> >>##programming
2015-04-05 15:48 <ruboto> phale # => nil (https://eval.in/308685)
2015-04-05 15:48 <phale> go there
2015-04-05 15:48 <ytti> but it's GC'd, which already excludes it from being low-level
2015-04-05 15:48 <sevenseacat> i like high-level things.
2015-04-05 15:49 <ytti> i also feel go isn't doing 'enough' it's pretty conservative and lacks lot of what people consider stables of modern languages
2015-04-05 15:49 <chridal> sevenseacat: Do you like control? Although high-level is nice, there is something beautiful about knowing everything that is running from the bottom up.
2015-04-05 15:49 <adaedra> Rust is nice, but difficult to handle
2015-04-05 15:49 <ytti> rust seems more ambitious

2015-04-05 18:45 <chridal> atmosx: Oh, so that is why the std library doesn't include an implementation of it. Thanks for telling me, because I am really just trying to solve a puzzle from exercism.io

2015-04-05 18:46 <atmosx> chridal: Nope, I don't think the ruby std library has anything to do with it. You can write a module to implement some sort of factorization. What I'm saying is that either you solve the Riemann Hypothesis or your implementation will be awfully slow (independently of any programming language) for any real world applications other then solving puzzles by factorizing small numbers.

2015-04-05 18:57 <hanmac> sdl and opengl are good, but imo i would prefer to put as much stuff as possible into bindings specially if they can do some higher rendering stuff like ogre of sfml

2015-04-05 19:20 <atmosx> I wonder if you could combine this with some betting algorithm.

For example if I set from_date = Feb 27th 5PM  and to_date = Feb 28th 8AM amd it is a reoccuring event, everyday between 5PM and 8AM it should happen. So I'm trying to say is if Time.now.utc is between 5pm and 8am please do xyz
2015-04-05 21:43 <djellemah> greenride: yeah, like I said it's not all that close. I'd be interested to hear if you find something that does what you're after, cos I've needed that before.
2015-04-05 21:43 <PhaseCode> If its not reoccuring it doesn't matter, we just strictly compare the two dates

2015-04-05 22:13 <zenspider> 'if a && a.b && a.b.c' is really no different than 'if a.b.c' and that is a violation of demeter. use null objects or transformations or just structure your shit right.

2015-04-05 22:15 <djellemah> PhaseCode: Something like this Time.parse('12:00',from_date.to_date). Basically you put Time.now into the date of from_date. I think that will work.

2015-04-05 22:39 <woop> howdy - I've got an API I'm in the process of revamping, and an idea put forward was to put the old one at something like "mysite.com/api/v1" and the new one at "mysite.com/api/v2" with the v2 api using all of v1's routes pointing to v1's controllers
2015-04-05 22:40 <woop> the idea is to have the v2 api present all of the relevant functionality right away as I replace the parts that need to be replaced
2015-04-05 22:40 <woop> is there some easy way to do this in rails' routes.rb, and is this even a good idea to do?

2015-04-05 22:48 <zenspider> iraszl_: have you done any other programming before?
2015-04-05 22:48 <iraszl_> yes, only php

2015-04-05 22:49 <iraszl_> i can run php code
2015-04-05 22:49 <woop> rails is the popular way to get that ruby to talk to web browsers

2015-04-05 22:50 <zenspider> I would bypass all the config shit and cheat using something like heroku

2015-04-05 22:50 <bradland> heroku is great when you're ready to deploy, but for local development, i'm not sure how it helps

2015-04-05 22:53 <bradland> even if you adopt a TDD approach, having a local dev copy of your app allows you to develop things that aren't a fit for TDD
2015-04-05 22:53 <bradland> like your CSS rendering, etc

2015-04-05 23:22 <zenspider> did you try?
2015-04-05 23:23 <FernandoBasso> Yes, and got unexpected tCONSTANT, expectingsyntax error, unexpected tCONSTANT, expecting ')'
2015-04-05 23:23 <FernandoBasso> Oh, dear.
2015-04-05 23:23 <FernandoBasso> My paste was messed up. Sorry.

2015-04-05 23:24 <apeiros> FernandoBasso: you'll want to add parens
2015-04-05 23:24 <zenspider> needs more parens: ruby -cwe 'return false unless (a.is_a?(Integer) && b.is_a?(Integer))'
2015-04-05 23:24 <zenspider> 
2015-04-05 23:24 <apeiros> FernandoBasso: or use `and`, but personally, I prefer parens
2015-04-05 23:25 <FernandoBasso> So, it was a precedence problem?

2015-04-05 23:26 <zenspider> but I wouldn't write that. I'd raise ArgumentError on each one individually
2015-04-05 23:26 <zenspider> which takes care of the precedence problem :)

2015-04-05 23:26 <FernandoBasso> Indeed. I'm just getting started with Ruby, and have no idea yet on best practices on handling invalid stuff.

2015-04-05 23:38 <zenspider> what'd it resolve to?
2015-04-05 23:39 <zenspider> does it just over-normalize first?
2015-04-05 23:39 <apeiros> it resolved the same as "apeiros.me"

2015-04-05 23:48 <apeiros> zenspider: nice find
2015-04-05 23:49 <apeiros> so there *is* a chance that's the only "normalization"
2015-04-05 23:49 <zenspider> well... there's 2856 other lines of code.... sooo...

2015-04-05 23:50 <apeiros> that's a good chance
2015-04-05 23:50 <apeiros> much better than winning the lottery.
2015-04-05 23:50 <eam> am I reading this right in that it doesn't distinguish between FQDN and not?
