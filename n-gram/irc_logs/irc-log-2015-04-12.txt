2015-04-12 00:07 <multi_io> shouldn't rbenv install shims for all executables of all gems in all ruby versions it knows about?

2015-04-12 00:12 <havenwood> multi_io: That's usually the rbenv answer it seems. There's no #rbenv to point folk to. If you get bored some day checkout chruby and leave the world of shims behind.

2015-04-12 01:42 <centrx> So e.g. monkey-patching only affects one area of your code, not overriding Hash everywhere

2015-04-12 01:57 <centrx> jwalk, whether you use the parent definition or the refinement definition depends on what the method is supposed to do
2015-04-12 01:57 <centrx> jwalk, if you don't define a method in the refinement, but call self.method, it will just go up the chain to the parent method

2015-04-12 03:19 <xxneolithicxx> multiple assignment looks like
2015-04-12 03:20 <xxneolithicxx> though it doesnt look right
2015-04-12 03:20 <mozzarella> should be
2015-04-12 03:20 <mozzarella> num.divmod 3600
2015-04-12 03:20 <xxneolithicxx> ahh method call ok
2015-04-12 03:21 <musashi> That's what I can't wrap my head around... It seems to work the way it is written.
2015-04-12 03:21 <mozzarella> divmod returns the division and modulo (remainder)

2015-04-12 03:28 <mozzarella> musashi: try teh following:
2015-04-12 03:28 <xxneolithicxx> i think the left menu needs more contrast separation or some color differentiation
2015-04-12 03:29 <mozzarella> p method(:divmod).parameters
2015-04-12 03:29 <xxneolithicxx> and i think the overall background and the background of the individual sections are too close in color (but thats just my preference)
2015-04-12 03:29 <shevy> xxneolithicxx interesting. I kind of went from pages to pages, downloading gnutls, libnettle, libogg and lots more things... and that was the first page that was actually visually pleasing (I just downloaded ffmpeg-2.6.2, currently compiling it)

2015-04-12 08:40 <wasamasa> there's pointer equality and structural equality
2015-04-12 08:40 <wasamasa> and stuff in-between those
2015-04-12 08:40 <wasamasa> I suspect eql? would qualify for that
2015-04-12 08:41 towski_ has joined #ruby
2015-04-12 08:42 <wasamasa> aha, == is structural equality and implemented by specific classes, eql? is pointer equality and implemented by Object, equal? should be the in-between one gem authors need to write themselves
2015-04-12 08:43 <apeiros> == is order equality
2015-04-12 08:43 <baash05> http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.2.1/Object.html#method-i-eql-3F
2015-04-12 08:43 <apeiros> that is, <=> returning zero implies == being true
2015-04-12 08:43 <baash05> That really nails it down well.

2015-04-12 08:43 <wasamasa> wat
2015-04-12 08:43 <apeiros> you even get == from defining <=> and including Comparable
2015-04-12 08:44 <apeiros> if your object does not implement <=>, == should be equivalent to eql?
2015-04-12 08:44 lewix has quit [Remote host closed the connection]
2015-04-12 08:45 <baash05> unless your object is a number :) then they == is not the same as eql?
2015-04-12 08:46 <baash05> 1.eql? 1.0   #=> false
2015-04-12 08:46 <apeiros> baash05: numbers have <=>
2015-04-12 08:46 <apeiros> and == is in terms of <=>
2015-04-12 08:47 <baash05> I love finding things like this out.. often they don't help, but once in a while they really do

2015-04-12 12:51 <hfp> Hey all, I would need a bit of advice. I am writing a module that fetches the per minute rate for a given phone number from an API. If it finds a rate, it will return a float for that rate. If it doesn't find the rate, it will return -1. Is this the right way of handling the "rate not found" case?
2015-04-12 12:52 <jhass> hfp: doesn't sound right no
2015-04-12 12:52 <jhass> if not found is a rare case and should probably make a user requested action fail, raise
2015-04-12 12:52 <jhass> else return nil

2015-04-12 12:53 <hfp> Thanks jhass
2015-04-12 12:54 <jhass> hfp: nil is falsey, so the caller can easily check for it

2015-04-12 12:55 <jhass> or rate = get_rate || default_value

2015-04-12 14:57 <freestyl3r> hello. i have a class method that needs to call an instance method. can it be done or do i need to make the instance method a class one as well?
2015-04-12 14:57 yetone has joined #ruby
2015-04-12 14:57 <freestyl3r> and if so, is there a way to hide that method from outside use? example: https://bpaste.net/raw/7d9698284a2a
2015-04-12 14:57 <shevy> depends; if you have initialized your object, you could just call the method on said object
2015-04-12 14:57 <undeadaedra> you can pass the instance to the class method as argument

2015-04-12 14:58 <shevy> and you have no instance of class First anywhere in that code
2015-04-12 14:58 <shevy> you could define a class method, and have an instance method call it
2015-04-12 14:58 enebo has quit [Ping timeout: 265 seconds]
2015-04-12 14:59 <freestyl3r> i do not want to create an instance of this class ever. i want people to only be able to call First.greet and hide from the my helper functions like insult
2015-04-12 14:59 <freestyl3r> *from them
2015-04-12 14:59 <shevy> freestyl3r for instance this code would work http://pastie.org/10088160

2015-04-12 15:00 <freestyl3r> ok i'll try to reword my question (sorry my english is not very good)
2015-04-12 15:00 phale has left #ruby ["Leaving"]
2015-04-12 15:00 <centrx> Doesn't sound like it should be a class
2015-04-12 15:01 <shevy> that is the first time that I hear that someone is trying to hide a class method :)
2015-04-12 15:01 <shevy> normally I'd hear that only for instance methods with public vs. private
2015-04-12 15:01 <shevy> you could try to use the keyword private
2015-04-12 15:01 <freestyl3r> i want the First class to only have one visible class method. the greet one. i want to be able to use helper methods but i don't want those to be visible to others
2015-04-12 15:01 <freestyl3r> (others = outside the class scope)

2015-04-12 15:02 <undeadaedra> Easiest way would be to have instance methods, as they can be private
2015-04-12 15:02 <undeadaedra> Then, if you want only one instance of your object, make it a Singleton
2015-04-12 15:03 reinaldob has quit [Remote host closed the connection]
2015-04-12 15:03 <freestyl3r> so, there is no way without creating class instances afaik

2015-04-12 15:05 <shevy> yeah I don't think I have heard of access restriction in regards to class-level methods before
2015-04-12 15:05 <shevy> you define a method and it is usually callable
2015-04-12 15:05 MatthewsFace has quit [Remote host closed the connection]
2015-04-12 15:05 <shevy> have you tried class << self; private yet?
2015-04-12 15:05 <shevy> I mean I never tried myself, I never would have had that idea
2015-04-12 15:07 Hijiri has quit [Ping timeout: 245 seconds]
2015-04-12 15:07 <freestyl3r> since the gem i'm trying to contribute makes classes but never makes any objects with them, does modules sound a better design decision?
2015-04-12 15:08 <shevy> not really
2015-04-12 15:08 <shevy> the only difference will be that you can "include" a module, which you can't with a class
2015-04-12 15:08 <shevy> well actually centrx is right
2015-04-12 15:08 <shevy> a module would seem more logical here
2015-04-12 15:08 <centrx> yeah if there's no instance

2015-04-12 15:11 <centrx> no
2015-04-12 15:11 <centrx> what's the point of all this
2015-04-12 15:11 <shevy> you can't ever really hide anything in ruby
2015-04-12 15:11 <shevy> there is .public_send but also .send

2015-04-12 17:36 <shevy> gcc and C is confusing
2015-04-12 17:36 <undeadaedra> ah ?
2015-04-12 17:36 <shevy> on linuxmint I have a location for libstdc++ here /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libstdc++.so.6
2015-04-12 17:37 <shevy> and poppler failed to compile stating that it can not find libstdc++.so.6
2015-04-12 17:37 <shevy> but /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/ was in my /etc/ld.so.conf and I ran ldconfig too
2015-04-12 17:37 <shevy> now I just copied that file one level down, into /usr/lib/
2015-04-12 17:37 <shevy> and poppler compiles fine
2015-04-12 17:37 <shevy> :\ :/ :\ :/
2015-04-12 17:38 <undeadaedra> libstdc++ is C++, not C
2015-04-12 17:38 <shevy> all is compiled via gcc
2015-04-12 17:38 <undeadaedra> but not by the same command
2015-04-12 17:38 <shevy> I should expect it to find what it installed
2015-04-12 17:38 <undeadaedra> which have different parameters
2015-04-12 17:38 <undeadaedra> even if linking should go though the same pass
2015-04-12 17:38 <shevy> the issue is not C++ or C but where the file was :D
2015-04-12 17:39 <undeadaedra> err, can be
2015-04-12 17:39 <shevy> like hardcoded #include directives
2015-04-12 17:39 <shevy> isn't there any language that fixes this?
2015-04-12 17:40 <undeadaedra> "fixes"
2015-04-12 17:40 <DerisiveLogic> So is it just me or is ruby in a state of decline

2015-04-12 17:42 <shevy> DerisiveLogic during the initial rails hype there was an increase, from like 2005 to 2009, that later subsided again
2015-04-12 17:42 <DerisiveLogic> shevy: That's what I figured, but it seems like it'll start declining probably in 2-3 years.

2015-04-12 17:42 <DerisiveLogic> Especially with all the node hype at the moment.
2015-04-12 17:42 <shevy> nah javascript can't be a competitor
2015-04-12 17:42 <undeadaedra> eurk, node.
2015-04-12 17:43 <shevy> all tasks that are automatable I wrote in ruby script. I would not know how to use javascript standalone in quite that way
2015-04-12 17:43 <shevy> *via ruby scripts
2015-04-12 17:43 <DerisiveLogic> shevy: How come?
2015-04-12 17:44 <DerisiveLogic> And which scripts?
2015-04-12 17:44 <shevy> all of them
2015-04-12 17:44 <shevy> ruby is general purpose after all
2015-04-12 17:44 <undeadaedra> code all the scripts!
2015-04-12 17:45 <shevy> a language that could replace ruby there would have to be able to do the very same things as well
2015-04-12 17:45 <shevy> how do you create a directory in javascript from a standalone file?
2015-04-12 17:45 <DerisiveLogic> Like not being async friendly?
2015-04-12 17:45 <undeadaedra> what?
2015-04-12 17:45 <shevy> do I need async for everything
2015-04-12 17:45 <zubov> I think Python is the biggest competitor
2015-04-12 17:45 <shevy> yeah
2015-04-12 17:46 <DerisiveLogic> How so?
2015-04-12 17:46 otisZart has joined #ruby
2015-04-12 17:46 <shevy> it will probably overtake PHP's share

2015-04-12 17:47 <jhass> DerisiveLogic: what are truly wondering here? why do you care how many people do use and will use Ruby in the near future?
2015-04-12 17:47 <zubov> scripting based language, easy of use, fast enough, tons of library/framework support
2015-04-12 17:47 <wasamasa> shevy: you'd use node for that
2015-04-12 17:47 <DerisiveLogic> jhass: So that I don't waste my time learning a language that I won't benefit monetarily from.

2015-04-12 17:48 <wasamasa> shevy: people have written streaming torrent clients in it
2015-04-12 17:48 <jhass> DerisiveLogic: IME every language I learned, applicable in a job that pays me or not, teached me at least one thing that improved my general skills and workflows as a programmer, so that point is moot to me
2015-04-12 17:49 <zubov> I prefer Ruby at this time.
2015-04-12 17:49 <DerisiveLogic> I rather learn Haskell than ruby at this point for pushing my skills as a programmer, definitely not ruby.
2015-04-12 17:49 <jhass> then do that
2015-04-12 17:49 <havenwood> DerisiveLogic: In several years Ruby will have broken new, novel ground. It will be a popular language along with most of the popular languages now as well as a few others. If you think Node is a threat to Ruby you're sorely mistaken.
2015-04-12 17:49 <jhass> DerisiveLogic: nobody cares
2015-04-12 17:50 <a5i> Ruby and haskell are different paradigms
2015-04-12 17:50 <a5i> how can u compare them ?
2015-04-12 17:50 <havenwood> DerisiveLogic: I thought HN already dropped Node for Go and dropped Go for Rust. Live in the now, man!
2015-04-12 17:50 <apeiros> what? people still use Rust?
2015-04-12 17:50 <apeiros> that's so yesterminute
2015-04-12 17:51 <shevy> DerisiveLogic haskell is so completely different, do you use a scripting language?
2015-04-12 17:51 <DerisiveLogic> Shots fired.
2015-04-12 17:51 <havenwood> As soon as Rust hit beta I was over it.

2015-04-12 20:33 <pangur> There is nobody answering in #sequel, apeiros.  That is why I asked here. There is no conversation in #sequel that I can see.
2015-04-12 20:33 <undeadaedra> #sequel is not very active, but there is activity sometimes.
2015-04-12 20:33 <pangur> I wondered if it were something wrong with my Ruby installation rather than to do with sequel at all.

2015-04-12 20:35 <ytti> pangur, i'm guessing your installation of sqlite3 failed, because it failed to compile native extension, due to missing dependencies

2015-04-12 22:36 <jhass> anskeit: got some examples?
2015-04-12 22:37 <centrx> anskeit, I'm not going to let you access my JSON keys without a good reason
2015-04-12 22:37 <anskeit> yea sure. http://pastebin.com/PaERmgp7 the number in the first row is changing and i have no clue how i can access the other stuff then
2015-04-12 22:37 <ruboto> anskeit, we in #ruby do not like pastebin.com, I reposted your paste to gist for you: https://gist.github.com/86e57aec7e90d233c805
2015-04-12 22:37 <ruboto> pastebin.com loads slowly for most, has ads which are distracting and has terrible formatting.

2015-04-12 22:40 <anskeit> there are 10 different ones and centrx, i dont understand your question. the number in the first row jsut changes everytime(its like a Player ID)
2015-04-12 22:40 <jhass> do you want all or just the first or?
2015-04-12 22:40 MatthewsFace has joined #ruby

2015-04-12 22:41 <centrx> anskeit, You can get all the values in order, but those number keys must have some meaning?
2015-04-12 22:41 <jhass> okay, if you want to stay vague you'll get a vague answer: iterate over the hash then, look at .each, .each_value, .values

2015-04-12 22:43 <anskeit> yea. these keys are the Id of a player in a game. im getting this id with a api call and his name. after that im tryhing to get his ladder ranking in the game and this is what i get back. but the key is changing, because the player isnt always the same.
