2015-04-07 02:16 <sevenseacat> are we supposed to be psychic and kick people *before* they troll?

2015-04-07 02:16 <krainboltgreene> The "we don't know about it so we can't act" excuse seems hollow when there are two equally large channels with pretty much the same demographic and both long histories of operating, but one is significantly more toxic than the other.
2015-04-07 02:17 <sevenseacat> :/
2015-04-07 02:17 <sevenseacat> i guess thats a yes... sorry, i'll work on developing my sixth sense.
2015-04-07 02:17 <krainboltgreene> This isn't to judge/put blame on you sevenseacat, it's just your message got me thinking about the differences.
2015-04-07 02:17 <Radar> krainboltgreene: can't tell if trolling or actually having a valid point.
2015-04-07 02:17 <Radar> krainboltgreene: We are not watching the channel 24/7.
2015-04-07 02:18 <sevenseacat> idiots exist on the internet. we can't prevent that.

2015-04-07 02:19 <weaksauce> krainboltgreene perhaps the higher number of trolls can be attributed to ruby had a checkered past w.r.t. hostility to women so the trolls are more apt to go there?

2015-04-07 02:20 <krainboltgreene> I wonder if #nodejs blocks that irc webclient.
2015-04-07 02:21 <sevenseacat> if they do, they'll also be blocking a lot of legitimate users

2015-04-07 02:21 <dodobrain> Radar, maybe krainboltgreene means that there needs to (a) a good signalling mechanism to 'energise' the ops (b) and more likely ops spread across timezones who may be likely to keep an eye out for stuff

2015-04-07 02:22 <krainboltgreene> Or "travis but for toxicity in irc rooms"

2015-04-07 02:22 <weaksauce> krainboltgreene ruby is also more well known and older so that's something too.
2015-04-07 02:22 <krainboltgreene> THEN developers will pay attention.
2015-04-07 02:22 <Radar> Ok, I think this is what we need: some way to signal the ops when there's trouble.
2015-04-07 02:22 <krainboltgreene> weaksauce: Compared to Node.js?
2015-04-07 02:22 <Radar> There's already !r but that's just for me

2015-04-07 02:23 <Radar> sevenseacat: that's ridiculous.
2015-04-07 02:23 <Radar> So can someone please add !ops command to https://github.com/radar/railsbot which reads a list of names from a yaml file?
2015-04-07 02:23 <pontiki> FORK THE CHANNEL
2015-04-07 02:23 andersoldahl has joined #ruby
2015-04-07 02:23 <Radar> yaml file contains a key which is the channel name, with array of names underneath it
2015-04-07 02:23 <Radar> when !op is said in a channel by an authorized user then those people on that list get notified

2015-04-07 02:25 <krainboltgreene> Started.
2015-04-07 02:25 <Radar> There isn't much code to it.
2015-04-07 02:26 <weaksauce> krainboltgreene ruby is 20 years old vs 6 to node.js as a framework.
2015-04-07 02:26 <krainboltgreene> https://github.com/radar/railsbot/pull/40
2015-04-07 02:26 <bradland> ah, it hought it was a moderated list
2015-04-07 02:26 <krainboltgreene> weaksauce: Oh come on, ruby wasn't public until 99 AFAIR.
2015-04-07 02:26 <Radar> krainboltgreene: add sevenseacat to that list. Also will need a list for #rubyonrails.

2015-04-07 08:47 <serivichi> on a sidenote. I've always wondered why our identities are still via nickservs. Wouldn't it be more portable and more secure, if we used public/private keypairs for nick auth>
2015-04-07 08:47 <serivichi> kind of like openID but for IRC?
2015-04-07 08:48 <serivichi> that's not to say that nickservs wont be needed, but they could be more portable
2015-04-07 08:48 <serivichi> e.g. "arup_r@freenode" where you public key is stored at freenode

2015-04-07 08:49 <serivichi> so when you go to a different IRC network, you don't have to resignup... but you could use a different network as your credentals

2015-04-07 10:34 <workmad3> maasha: end of the day, yard is a documentation language... if you prefer it, use it... if your team is using it, use it... otherwise don't stress :P
2015-04-07 10:34 <maasha> workmad3: right, I guess I am looking for style-guidance and best practices.
2015-04-07 10:34 <maasha> style is pretty well covered in the yard documentation,
2015-04-07 10:35 <maasha> practices appears to be an open subject.
2015-04-07 10:35 <workmad3> because, barring someone actually figuring out useful metrics for comparing documentation languages, you can't determine 'better'... and once someone *has* figured that out, you can decide whether those metrics are important to you
2015-04-07 10:36 <maasha> workmad3: well, no. OTOH the same could be said about the Ruby styleguide.
2015-04-07 10:36 <workmad3> maasha: the ruby styleguide is a set of preferences... you're free to disagree, and there's nothing out there stating that it's "the best" in an objectively meaningful way
2015-04-07 10:38 <maasha> workmad3: I think the Ruby styleguide made me reflect on my code in a constructive manner. I would like the same to happen documentation-wise :o)

2015-04-07 10:40 <canton7> you probably want to ban *!*@gateway/web/cgi-irc/kiwiirc.com/ip.65.49.14.15 ?
2015-04-07 10:40 <maasha> we are awaiting the invention of a device allowing you to stab someone in the face across in the internet.
2015-04-07 10:40 <apeiros> flughafen: one guy who doesn't take lightly that he got banned.
2015-04-07 10:41 <canton7> (bless kiwiirc for putting the client's ip in the host)
2015-04-07 10:41 <flughafen> apeiros: who did you ban?
2015-04-07 10:41 <workmad3> maasha: great, so the ruby styleguide gave you an incentive to instrospect on your own personal preferences regarding ruby code style
2015-04-07 10:41 <apeiros> flughafen: you'll know him as deathcode
2015-04-07 10:41 <apeiros> if you know him, that is
2015-04-07 10:41 <flughafen> apeiros: hahaha.
2015-04-07 10:41 <flughafen> yeah, i've seen in here saying stupid stuff
2015-04-07 10:42 <maasha> ok, lunch
2015-04-07 10:42 <Mon_Ouie> Oh yeah, client's default banmask. But then again, he seems to keep coming back so neither will really matter.
2015-04-07 10:42 <apeiros> stupid stuff didn't get him banned, though

2015-04-07 10:42 <workmad3> maasha: now you recognise that such a thing is good, you can go and look at the styleguides for yard, rdoc, etc. and do similar instrospection on them... recognising that it's personal preferences is important though, because then you can actually see past the hyperbole and posturing of people espousing 'best practices' without evidence ;P

2015-04-07 10:44 <workmad3> if he knew what he was doing, he could have refreshed a VPN IP address by now and rejoined with a different hostmask

2015-04-07 11:52 <jhass> never heard that term before tbh
2015-04-07 11:52 <jhass> I'd related it to for example inline JS
2015-04-07 11:52 <jhass> where you embed it on the page vs having another file
2015-04-07 11:53 <maasha> ok
2015-04-07 11:54 <wm3|away> or you either have code inline, or you extract it out into a method

2015-04-07 11:55 <wm3|away> in compiled languages, you also have the compiler optimisation of code-inlining, where it will have rules that allow it to determine if a particular method call can be compiled to be inline, removing the overhead of the method call from the compiled binary
2015-04-07 11:55 <jhass> ah true, good point
2015-04-07 11:55 <wm3|away> none of those seem to be applicable to maasha's use though :)

2015-04-07 12:55 <Igorshp> i believe it's the issue with default_config
2015-04-07 12:55 <ddv> Igorshp: you need to figure out why iam_creds is called multiple times, maybe it only does that when it returns nil (iamcreds)
2015-04-07 12:55 <toertore> and how you're testing that it "works"
2015-04-07 12:55 <Igorshp> hmm, it didnt occur to me it wasnt a defautl ruby function

2015-04-07 13:19 <jhass> why do you need to differentiate?
2015-04-07 13:21 <Igorshp> sure;  iam_creds will always return session_token when availalbe. but if user is overriding the key_id, the session_token should be nil.  so in effect, if iam_creds is available, it is impossible to override

2015-04-07 13:51 <Igorshp> here's scenario: iam creds fetches aws iam_role credentials on the node, if they are available(and for this scenario they are). key_id, secret and session_token.  That part works great. However, the user may want to override the credentials for some reason. the user would set key_id and secret. When he now runs kitchen, key_id and secret are the overriden values, but session_token is obtained from iam_role. that session token does not match key_
2015-04-07 13:51 <Igorshp> id and secret and the auth fails
2015-04-07 13:51 mengu has quit [Client Quit]
2015-04-07 13:52 <Igorshp> the problem is as simple as setting session_token=nil if key_id and secret is provided by user

2015-04-07 14:04 <jhass> I tend to only put stuff to run testsuite into development dependencies and everything beyond into the Gemfile
2015-04-07 14:04 <echelon> like.. finding out what other gems depend on a given dependency
2015-04-07 14:04 <workmad3> jhass: sounds reasonable... I'd guess 'everything else' is really 'tools jhass finds useful as part of his dev workflow'? :)
2015-04-07 14:05 <jhass> yeah
2015-04-07 14:05 <echelon> the only thing i can think of is looping through 'gem list' and grepping for any instance of the given gem
2015-04-07 14:05 <jhass> yard, pry, coveralls, stuff like that
2015-04-07 14:05 <workmad3> jhass: hmm... I'd be tempted to put yard in as a dev dependency if you're writing yardoc in your code
2015-04-07 14:05 <echelon> and how do i get rid of unused deps
2015-04-07 14:06 <echelon> when doing a gem uninstall

2015-04-07 14:40 <echelon> so how do i modify $LOAD_PATH in the code
2015-04-07 14:40 <adaedra> by modifying $LOAD_PATH :)
2015-04-07 14:41 <adaedra> it’s a global variable
2015-04-07 14:41 <jhass> and an Array

2015-04-07 15:12 <sugardrunk> hello, is there a way to get a single element from a Set
2015-04-07 15:12 <sugardrunk> ?
2015-04-07 15:12 Coraline is now known as Coraline_ZzZz

2015-04-07 15:13 naftilos76 has joined #ruby
2015-04-07 15:13 <apeiros> sugardrunk: to a degree. what do you need?
2015-04-07 15:14 GnuYawk has joined #ruby
2015-04-07 15:14 <sugardrunk> jhass: any single element from my set... just started Ruby today but I know programming :D
2015-04-07 15:14 <sugardrunk> just so confused with all right now
2015-04-07 15:14 <jhass> any as in random?
2015-04-07 15:14 <sugardrunk> not random
2015-04-07 15:14 <sugardrunk> first or last or any
2015-04-07 15:14 <apeiros> sugardrunk: you might be using the wrong datastructure. Set#first should work.
2015-04-07 15:15 _maes_ has joined #ruby
2015-04-07 15:15 <apeiros> note that "first" is misleading. sets are generally not ordered.
2015-04-07 15:15 <jhass> yeah, depending on the order of a set is fishy
2015-04-07 15:15 <apeiros> sugardrunk: why do you use a set?
2015-04-07 15:15 <sugardrunk> I wanted unique values and to try a set :)
2015-04-07 15:16 tuelz has joined #ruby
2015-04-07 15:16 <sugardrunk> but maybe I do it how I know... because I _do not know_ Ruby
2015-04-07 15:16 <apeiros> sugardrunk: ok. that sounds sensible.
2015-04-07 15:16 Takle_ has quit [Remote host closed the connection]
2015-04-07 15:16 <apeiros> and now you want "any value" from your set to see which unique values ended up in the set?
2015-04-07 15:16 <tuelz> so many DSLs, why can't we all just use 0's and 1's?
2015-04-07 15:17 <apeiros> tuelz: you're free to use 0's and 1's exclusively :)
2015-04-07 15:17 <tuelz> apeiros: don't tell me what to do
2015-04-07 15:17 <workmad3> tuelz: I dislike 0 and 1... I much prefer +3.3 and -3.3
2015-04-07 15:17 <sugardrunk> apeiros: I just cannot print out any single values from it (a bit funny)
2015-04-07 15:17 <apeiros> tuelz: then again, 0's and 1's is a DSL in itself :-p

2015-04-07 15:17 <havenwood> tuelz: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1BdQcJ2ZYY
2015-04-07 15:18 <workmad3> tuelz: does godelisation of formal systems into number theory count? :)
2015-04-07 15:18 <tuelz> workmad3: I understood half of what you just said, so I'd say you're on the right track.
2015-04-07 15:18 <sugardrunk> apeiros: something like s[0] won't work
2015-04-07 15:18 <jhass> sugardrunk: yeah, a set is not a sequence
2015-04-07 15:19 <apeiros> sugardrunk: correct, because sets are not positional. as said, they're not ordered.
2015-04-07 15:19 <sugardrunk> oh... now I'm getting a bit...
2015-04-07 15:19 <apeiros> sugardrunk: you can do s.to_a[0]
2015-04-07 15:19 <sugardrunk> ok!
2015-04-07 15:19 <sugardrunk> let me try more stuff and drink some coffee
2015-04-07 15:19 <sugardrunk> thanks

2015-04-07 17:31 <csaunders> on most systems it'll be that Ruby. The other ones you typically have to install yourself (rbx, jruby, etc.) And they'll say it in the version
2015-04-07 17:31 <csaunders> i.e. jruby - jruby 1.7.18 (1.9.3p551) 2014-12-22 625381c on Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM 1.7.0_17-b02 +jit [darwin-x86_64]

2015-04-07 17:39 <Senjai> Point being, is yes, I'm super pro composition, but not for the sake of composition :P. There are legitimate opporunities for inheritance
2015-04-07 17:39 <jhass> I actually can see a point of an abstract class with enforced implementations by childs in Ruby
2015-04-07 17:39 <Senjai> Aye
2015-04-07 17:39 <jhass> the fun part is that the current Ruby model would cause compile time errors in Crystal
2015-04-07 17:39 <Senjai> That's what I would be voting for
2015-04-07 17:39 <jhass> if you mess up
2015-04-07 17:40 <Senjai> By not implimenting a template method?
2015-04-07 17:40 <jhass> for example
2015-04-07 17:40 <jhass> but things like returning a type that doesn't respond to a method the caller expects on it too etc
2015-04-07 17:41 <Senjai> One thing I'm happy about with interpreted languages, is that they force you to get into good habits with testing, well not force, but strongly encourage
2015-04-07 17:41 <jhass> and thinking about it, we could make abstract def work for modules too in Ruby
2015-04-07 17:41 <jhass> yeah true
2015-04-07 17:41 <Senjai> Working in C++ the past few days, so many rely on the compiler to do some of their testing for them

2015-04-07 17:42 <jhass> compilers catch the common mistakes early
2015-04-07 17:42 <Senjai> jhass: I'm not sure about that. I wouldn't want multiple inheritance to be too wildly encouraged. I simply would want modules used for mixins or implimenting common interfaces. I could see people going cray cray if they get encouraged to do really crazy things with them
2015-04-07 17:42 <Senjai> Instead of composition
2015-04-07 17:43 <Senjai> jhass: Yeah, but you should still write tests. Many native communities don't
2015-04-07 17:43 <jhass> well, preventing people from stupid things is not something Ruby is good at :P
2015-04-07 17:43 <Senjai> Or only do it for run time related things, or regression testing
2015-04-07 17:43 <Senjai> I wouldn't disagree with you :P
2015-04-07 17:43 <jhass> I'd do for production stuff
2015-04-07 17:43 <jhass> that one's hobby, so I didn't care
2015-04-07 17:43 <jhass> I'll probably backfil once I extract the IRC library/framework into its own project
2015-04-07 17:44 <Senjai> I'm talking about production code though. Like C++ prod code, with very few tests. It's insane! Especially because of how many things can go TERRIBLY wrong with C++.

2015-04-07 18:13 <naftilos76> Hi, is there a way to capture data from linux terminal apps like 'dstat' which returns a new line of system statistics based on an interval defined by the user. I could certainly capture a one-time-execution return string by doing in the case of dstat while in a ruby script: `dstat -cndm --float --freespace 1 0` . This executes once and therefore i can do var = `system command` . But what if the app can operate on a time interval? Is there a way to
2015-04-07 18:13 <naftilos76> capture every new line of dstat ?

2015-04-07 18:44 <jhass> it's for projects that use bundler, not for gems
2015-04-07 18:44 <GaryOak_> but I mean when you are doing a project
2015-04-07 18:45 <Senjai> jhass: I would declare my dependencies, to be dependencies. They shouldn't change.
2015-04-07 18:45 <GaryOak_> or building a gem
2015-04-07 18:45 <Senjai> If you want to support multiple databases, include all of the adapters
2015-04-07 18:45 <Senjai> If you want to include things that only work with a specific driver, just add it as a dependency
2015-04-07 18:45 <jhass> no, I won't demand from my users to install dev headers for something they don't need

2015-04-07 20:22 <evanjs> seems strange, maybe functional programming methodologies could help
2015-04-07 20:22 <TheGugaru> evanjs LOL no sorry that is not true
2015-04-07 20:22 <evanjs> whats not true that it loads in less than 10 seconds?
2015-04-07 20:22 <TheGugaru> When doing business software the goal is to automate their paperwork and to automate paperwork and document generation can take a ton of fields to achieve. Business software is in a playpen all of its own.
2015-04-07 20:23 <TheGugaru> you state was not true
2015-04-07 20:23 <TheGugaru> I am already using functional programming methodologies
2015-04-07 20:23 <TheGugaru> the business logic and display is just massive

2015-04-07 20:25 <TheGugaru> eam greater number of fields means more business logic more business logic means more processing code. So therefor in this instance it is relevant to complexity my friend.

2015-04-07 21:04 <wasamasa> well, I want to provide a refinement with it, having both a require and using-line next to each other looks ugly

2015-04-07 21:05 <wasamasa> alternatively, what are known gems using that method?
2015-04-07 21:05 <centrx> ActiveSupport::Autoload is good for autoloading

2015-04-07 21:21 <helpa> Hi Sonny_Jim. We in #ruby would really appreciate it if you did not use pastebin during your time with us.
2015-04-07 21:21 <helpa> Pastebin is not good because it loads slowly for most, has ads which are distracting and has terrible formatting. Please use Gist (http://gist.github.com) or Pastie (http://pastie.org) instead. Thanks!

2015-04-07 21:50 <noober03> i am looking for all hashtags in a string, but i want to do this as a active record query so i can count the number of each hashtag appears
2015-04-07 21:50 <baweaver> also, doing this with AR is not going to work well, you'd likely need something like SOLR for full text search

2015-04-07 21:55 <baweaver> apeiros: I'd think the only reasonable way to do it would be something like SOLR, as this is likely a twitter-like full text search
2015-04-07 21:55 <jhass> you'd be surprised how far you get with the acts-as-taggable-on approach ;)
2015-04-07 21:56 <apeiros> if you search more than once, I'm pretty sure preprocessing will be faster than any full text search
2015-04-07 21:56 <c355E3B> Also it saves you from dealing with SOLR
2015-04-07 21:56 <c355E3B> Which is not fun

2015-04-07 23:27 <helpa> What "didn't work"? Did your server not start? Did your computer explode? Did your webpage turn bright pink? Did your client not pay your bill on time? You may have to be more specific. A Gist (http://gist.github.com) of the code that doesn't work (and the error you are getting) will be helpful.
