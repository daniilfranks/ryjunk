2015-04-15 00:10 <centrx> Secnz, inserting a variable within the string
2015-04-15 00:11 <vulix> Is there any comprehensive changelog that shows what gets deprecated every version of Ruby? Im currently on Windows and am worried that using one of the pre-packaged but older releases is going to be counter-productive for learning
2015-04-15 00:11 <bricker> vulix: https://github.com/ruby/ruby/blob/trunk/ChangeLog
2015-04-15 00:11 <vulix> bricker tyvm
2015-04-15 00:12 <centrx> vulix, What version will you be using?
2015-04-15 00:12 <shevy> Secnz this is calling the .to_s method.  Rather than: @name = "foo"; "@name #{@name}"  you could also do:  '@name '+@name.to_s
2015-04-15 00:13 <vulix> Ruby installer lets me grab 2.2.1 but I'm finding setting up Rails with it is giving me some trouble (specifically, something with Sqlite3). RailsInstaller gives me 2.1.5

2015-04-15 00:13 <shevy> string interpolation should also be faster than when you use +  and .to_s by yourself
2015-04-15 00:13 <shevy> and is also more failsave; you could forget to use .to_s
2015-04-15 00:14 <shevy> and may have a nil object there... "  "+nil+"  " would not work
2015-04-15 00:14 <shevy> *failsafe
2015-04-15 00:14 <weaksauce> centrx you might want to add that it's any expression that can be to_s'd
2015-04-15 00:14 <Secnz> shevy: But why do you have to do that, isn't @name already a string?

2015-04-15 00:15 <centrx> vulix, 1.9 is the main rubicon
2015-04-15 00:15 <shevy> Secnz in this case it should not make a big difference
2015-04-15 00:15 <jhass> Secnz: "string #{interpolation}" is more idiomatic and failsafe, stick to it, don't do "string" + concatenation
2015-04-15 00:15 <vulix> centrx tyvm. Is there a major difference between 2.1.5 and 2.2.1?
2015-04-15 00:15 <centrx> vulix, no
2015-04-15 00:15 <vulix> Ah I see. 1.9 was the first I put it down a few years ago and now am back to pick up Ruby again
2015-04-15 00:15 <shevy> Secnz but when you use a larger class, with several different @ivars, you may be confused what they are.. array..hash ... nil... integer
2015-04-15 00:15 <Secnz> How does Ruby know if my input should be handled as an integer or string then?

2015-04-15 00:16 <vulix> Sencz it's a weak typed language so it figures it out based on what mehtods you call on the variable

2015-04-15 00:51 <jhass> sooo, back to your code
2015-04-15 00:51 <jhass> you check that i is a prime, what do you next?
2015-04-15 00:51 <riskish> increase a counter

2015-04-15 00:52 <sevenseacat> so now i is not going to be prime anymore
2015-04-15 00:52 <jhass> yeah, I think I give up
2015-04-15 00:52 <sevenseacat> as we just established that any prime + 1 is not prime
2015-04-15 00:52 <jhass> immune to logic :/
2015-04-15 00:53 tubuliferous has joined #ruby
2015-04-15 00:53 <riskish> but then the while loop will go around and check, and it will say its not prime, and then it will increase again to an odd number, and try again, right?

2015-04-15 00:58 <havenwood> oh, i thought we were talking about the proposed changes to the prime algo in Ruby
2015-04-15 00:58 <baweaver> lazy is just a more succinct way to phrase some things. Takes something like Haskell for it to be efficient.

2015-04-15 02:09 <vulix> Ruby 2.1.5 and Rails 4.1
2015-04-15 02:09 <sevenseacat> good enough.
2015-04-15 02:09 <Paradox> so…i actually used the flipflop operator at work the other day
2015-04-15 02:09 <vulix> I know a CVE just went out so 2.2.2 is where I'd want to be for production but w/e

2015-04-15 02:10 <sevenseacat> you could have picked ruby 2.2.1, but eh
2015-04-15 02:10 <sevenseacat> 2.1.5 is fine
2015-04-15 02:10 <vulix> I was having issues with RubyInstaller.org
2015-04-15 02:10 <vulix> I can get Rails installed manually using gems, but when it comes to SQLite it has some issues

2015-04-15 02:14 <vulix> gem install RubyInline found my answer
2015-04-15 02:15 <vulix> so if I build a gem using ruby inline, can I bundle rubyinline with my gem or does any user have to download both separately?
2015-04-15 02:15 <sevenseacat> you can make your gem depend on other gems.

The C bindings will be great for widening any crippling bottlenecks

2015-04-15 03:59 <Sypheren> So characteristics (denoted by the @ symbol) allow variables to exist within a whole class, and not only with in a method?

2015-04-15 04:00 <sevenseacat> @ denotes instance variables - a variable belonging to the instance of the class. accessible from every instance method.
2015-04-15 04:01 <sevenseacat> eg. if you had a Dog class, then an instance might have a @name (every dog has a name, right?)

2015-04-15 04:04 <Sypheren> Right! So any @variable will only be accessible to methods inside of the class that it was defined in. While normal variable = *stuff* would only be accessible inside of the method?
2015-04-15 04:05 <sevenseacat> right, that would be a local variable.
2015-04-15 04:05 <Sypheren> I see! You used the same example codecademy did
2015-04-15 04:05 <Sypheren> They use Dog a lot
2015-04-15 04:05 <sevenseacat> that was purely by coincidence, ive never used codecademy lol
2015-04-15 04:05 <Sypheren> I'm learning Rails :3
2015-04-15 04:05 <Sypheren> The Ruby part came eaily... Rails... not so much
2015-04-15 04:06 <sevenseacat> to pick a different example, every instance of a Tweet model would have @content, for example

2015-04-15 04:07 <Sypheren> I'm still having a hard time understanding how Rails does its thing >_<
2015-04-15 04:08 <sevenseacat> i'm primarily a Rails developer, so, my apologies
2015-04-15 04:08 <sevenseacat> if you have questions specifically on Rails, you can jump over to #rubyonrails to get more specialized help
2015-04-15 04:08 <Sypheren> You're perfectly fine! I just don't know what a model is exactly yet, I've heard the term though
2015-04-15 04:08 <sevenseacat> (i'll answer you there too)
2015-04-15 04:08 <Sypheren> I'm in that channel too :3
2015-04-15 04:08 <Sypheren> Thank you :)

2015-04-15 06:45 <hanmac1> vulix: i prefer to write the C bindings myself in C(++) because with that i have more control over the code/memory
2015-04-15 06:46 <vulix> How do you embed them in your ruby code?
2015-04-15 06:46 <hanmac1> vulix: just with require? the binding self got compiled as native one without RubyInline
2015-04-15 06:47 <vulix> hanmac1 sorry I'm new to Ruby, not quite following. You can just have some C++ and import it natively and call methods from it? Or...?
2015-04-15 06:49 <hanmac1> vulix: Ruby (the MRI one and some others too) does have an C-API interface ... with that you can connect C(++) structures and functions into Ruby Objects and other way around ... for sample nokogiri is such a native binding

2015-04-15 06:52 <hanmac1> vulix: for sample in one of my bindings would a WX::Color#red call turn the ruby object into a wxColor* pointer and call the color->GetRed() function from that and then use INT2NUM to turn the returned C Int into an Ruby Integer

2015-04-15 11:17 <jhass> source also takes all kind of VCS URLs, git://, hg:// svn:// and so on and makepkg automatically fetches that and calls pkgver() and replaces the pkgver variable with it
2015-04-15 11:18 <jhass> so you just rebuilt such a package if you want to update to the latest development version of something

2015-04-15 13:49 <sanguisdex> jhass: I have been a developer for years, but mainly php. The hardest part about going from php to ruby is the each of multi dimensional arrays, and a more symbolic (operator driven) syntax.
2015-04-15 13:49 <sanguisdex> So in your above each, I understand that inside of that do loop the i would represent the array index being accessed

2015-04-15 14:10 <ninjs> Let me phrase my question differently.  My company works with claim software that produces claims in two file types, with two different extensions.  '.ub4' and '.npi'  I need to write something in ruby that can go through a directory, parse each file, and then spit out some kind of output file. I've got the output part managed, but I'm struggling where to
2015-04-15 14:10 <ninjs> start with the input

2015-04-15 14:13 <ninjs> When you say structure... if I open it with the claim software all the values are mapped to places on the page.  If I open them in a text editor or excel, all the values are like per line
2015-04-15 14:13 <adaedra> no

2015-04-15 14:13 <toretore> so your question is, how do i parse some random format for which no spec exists?
2015-04-15 14:14 <apeiros> that will get you the whole data in a string
2015-04-15 14:14 <ninjs> Right! haha
2015-04-15 14:14 <certainty> toretore: spot on
2015-04-15 14:14 <apeiros> as to how to parse - depends *a lot* on how the data is actually structured
2015-04-15 14:14 <ninjs> Well I can read the values...
2015-04-15 14:14 <apeiros> there are parser generators like racc and ragel
2015-04-15 14:14 <toretore> and the answer is ad adaedra said, reverse engineer it
2015-04-15 14:14 <apeiros> there are parser libraries like parslet and treetop
2015-04-15 14:14 <ddv> curl -v 10.0.1.1/ -H "Host: irrelevant" -H "Range: bytes=0-18446744073709551615”

2015-04-15 14:15 <certainty> parslet even

2015-04-15 14:16 <certainty> more like looking at the data and trying to spot the pattern
2015-04-15 14:16 <apeiros> ninjs: xml would be a way of structuring, yes.
2015-04-15 14:16 <apeiros> but it could also be a binary data format
2015-04-15 14:17 <apeiros> or some plaintext serialization

2015-04-15 14:17 <avril14th> Hello, any hint on how should one write a client that fires request to a server that has some request throttling limits (rejects all requests if more than 30 per 60 seconds)?
2015-04-15 14:17 <apeiros> especially not without having any examples.
2015-04-15 14:17 <ninjs> That's the frustrating part. There's no format. If I open it in .txt format, it's just like  one of the values, some breaks, another value, some breaks

2015-04-15 14:18 <ddv> avril14th: pretty simple, just record the timestamp of the last request
2015-04-15 14:18 <certainty> ninjs: did you try to run file(1) on it? maybe worth a shot
2015-04-15 14:19 <ninjs> I guess it could be possible that they are just mapping values on each line to a box.. that would sort of make sense
2015-04-15 14:19 <avril14th> ddv: that won't be enough. Since you also need to know how many requests were made on the past rolling 60 seconds. Now, the server API also supports batches (meaning to take one request for several jobs instead of one request per job, so I could merge my tasks and fire much less requests)
2015-04-15 14:19 <ddv> avril14th: yeah so record that too
2015-04-15 14:20 lolmaus has joined #ruby
2015-04-15 14:20 <avril14th> well, yeah, though it would be much better to use the batch interface
2015-04-15 14:21 <avril14th> since I could still hit the limit of requests per minute and so have a growing queue that could never reduce

2015-04-15 14:32 <ninjs> Good news... If I do  f = File.open('filename.ext', 'r') and then f.readline  ... I can go through the file and find the values as strings with \r\n at the end of them.. So I could maybe write something that for each file, go through each line and store the value, then output it through the Spreadsheet gem? Sorry I'm just kind of thinking outloud but I want
2015-04-15 14:32 <ninjs> to make sure I have the right idea

2015-04-15 18:19 <eam> not that racism is primarily a function of where one stands on a left/right spectrum
2015-04-15 18:19 <eam> in the US, most racists self-identify with the left
2015-04-15 18:19 <atmosx> eam: well it was kinda associated with far-right. But generally speaking it's poverty which gives political space to extremists
2015-04-15 18:19 <eam> and both sides think the other is racist

Basically an interpreter, and specific functions handled in Ruby not C. Which gives my familiar coding and dynamic stuff.

2015-04-15 20:04 <toretore> what you're talking about is synchronous code; the alternative is asynchronous code, but it's usually pretty clear from the context if that's the case
2015-04-15 20:05 <ninjs> because file_operation uses some files in a directory to create an output file, then move moves those files to a different directory
2015-04-15 20:05 <toretore> it's not something you should be worrying about
2015-04-15 20:05 <ninjs> Great. That's what I wanted to hear haha
2015-04-15 20:05 <Sou|cutter> ninjs: "most likely" is only a qualifier because without knowing the context, the implementation of method1 could do something asyncronously. You would probably know

2015-04-15 20:09 <xxneolithicxx> its like they have given up on learning
2015-04-15 20:09 <tcrypt> how old do you mean?
2015-04-15 20:09 <shellfu> besides VCS is just VCS it doesnt matter. Its like getting on a dude for using joe or emacs or vim or textmate or pen and paper
2015-04-15 20:09 <shellfu> ok maybe not pen and paper :)
2015-04-15 20:09 <toretore> maybe older people just have the experience to know that newer isn't usually better and that jumping on the latest trend is usually just a way to introduce more complexity and uncertainty
2015-04-15 20:09 <ytti> i thought everyone uses google as UI to git
2015-04-15 20:10 <shellfu> heh
2015-04-15 20:10 <xxneolithicxx> theres a difference between jumping on a source control trend and not knowing how to do it at all
2015-04-15 20:10 <ytti> because it's hella confusing the moment you're doing something new
2015-04-15 20:10 <ytti> then you fat finger question to google, and cheap from stackexcahnge

2015-04-15 20:14 <Nilium> If you just use git or mercurial as though it were svn, you're probably better with mercurial or just using svn.

2015-04-15 20:20 <xxneolithicxx> Nilium: i had to introduce them to orphan branches on the first day due to how our project was being used
2015-04-15 20:20 <xxneolithicxx> did not go well
2015-04-15 20:20 <dudedudeman> ytti: i may have mistyped. i think it's just a capitalized first line
2015-04-15 20:20 <Nilium> xxneolithicxx: I almost had to do that with an SVN migration where we were tagging subdirectories
2015-04-15 20:20 <ytti> dudedudeman, fair enough
2015-04-15 20:20 <Nilium> Ultimately I decided to just truncate the directory structure and re-merge later.

2015-04-15 20:30 <Nilium> Are you write your own muxer or something?
2015-04-15 20:30 <jhass> dudedudeman: .gsub, or define tag like %(tag) (iirc) and String#%
2015-04-15 20:31 <dudedudeman> so many words...
2015-04-15 20:31 <dudedudeman> and zenspider_, i'm in Sinatra for this
2015-04-15 20:31 <dudedudeman> don't know if the rails dudes would hate me
2015-04-15 20:31 <jhass> or actually String#[]= should work too (it's just sub anyway)
2015-04-15 20:31 <Nilium> Otherwise, uh, url["/monitors/".length..-1] and then slice to the next slash.
2015-04-15 20:31 <zenspider_> then... #sinatra ?
2015-04-15 20:31 <dudedudeman> wait, that exists?

2015-04-15 20:53 <tubuliferous> Hey folks, I want to connect to a publically-accessible folder on a web server and recursively download all of the files that match a particular regex
2015-04-15 20:53 <ninjs> matugm: yeah, thanks! Doesn't work for "" strings though. D:
2015-04-15 20:54 <Nilium> pagios: That should hopefully work.
2015-04-15 20:54 <Nilium> Does for me, at least.
2015-04-15 20:54 <tubuliferous> *publicly =)
2015-04-15 20:54 <toretore> tubuliferous: curl or wget
2015-04-15 20:54 <tubuliferous> ah...yeah...
2015-04-15 20:54 <tubuliferous> good call
2015-04-15 20:54 <tubuliferous> thanks toretore
2015-04-15 20:54 <pagios> Nilium: can you share your .projection line?
2015-04-15 20:54 <pagios>  result2 = client[:'userTable'].find({"token" => token}).projection(:arn => 1)
2015-04-15 20:54 <ninjs> oh, .reject(&:empty) works for that. :D :D
2015-04-15 20:54 <Nilium> .projection(Foo: 1)
2015-04-15 20:55 <pagios> not good for me still
2015-04-15 20:55 <Nilium> e.g., cli['collectionName'].find.projection(Foo: 1)
2015-04-15 20:55 <Nilium> After which you get a cursor.
2015-04-15 20:55 <pagios> i want to find a specific token
2015-04-15 20:55 <pagios> so find needs to take an argument
2015-04-15 20:55 <Nilium> Then search for it as part of the find call

2015-04-15 21:05 <p8952> zenspider, by default it doesn't. I could monkeypatch Test::Unit::TestCase with begin/rescue to call teardown on failure but I was hoping there was a more correct way
2015-04-15 21:05 <vulix> how often do core libraries and function calls break with ruby updates? I know 1.9 -> 2 was huge, but what about 2.1 -> 2.2?
2015-04-15 21:05 <zenspider> well... I'd like it to happen together, if at all possible... I don't want to leave those in #ruby-lang out in the cold. I still find the signal:noise better there

2015-04-15 21:06 <p8952> zenspider, in > 1.9 Test:Unit is provided by minitest
2015-04-15 21:06 <shevy> vulix don't think there were any major changes from 2.1 to 2.2 ... GC collects symbols now if I remember correctly, not sure when that happened... syntax: no change I think
2015-04-15 21:06 <zenspider> all in all, I'd say that the 2.x line has done a pretty good job of stabilizing

2015-04-15 21:16 <shevy> dunno if "def self.varname=argname" would be valid, I think you must use the ()?  "def self.bla=(i)"

2015-04-15 21:33 <Nilium> thomcom: I have enough screens to do that, but I don't really want to see them all, just need to remember which one is which for when I occasionally go to check something
2015-04-15 21:33 <Nilium> I think I just need to close them more proactively.. it's like browser tabs.
2015-04-15 21:33 <Nilium> Though in the case of browser tabs, I have a plugin auto-closing old ones.

2015-04-15 21:35 <weaksauce> also ninjs  you can't access newsheet1 from across function calls
2015-04-15 21:35 <ninjs> weaksauce: I can't use a hash if multiple keys correspond to one value, right?
2015-04-15 21:35 <ninjs> weaksauce: That's what I was afraid of
2015-04-15 21:35 <ninjs> So I'm not sure how to store the information I get out of that function call
2015-04-15 21:35 <weaksauce> huh
2015-04-15 21:36 jottr has joined #ruby
2015-04-15 21:36 <ninjs> I suppose I *don't* need to make that into a function, I can store it all in the file_operation function, just under the if statement..
2015-04-15 21:36 <weaksauce> an elsif would stop at the first match anyway ninjs
2015-04-15 21:37 <ninjs> Right, but I need for example both '1002' and '1001' to return 'RTC'
2015-04-15 21:37 <thomcom> keep an array as the hash value ninjs

2015-04-15 21:37 <weaksauce> you could yield each keypair and do it from a block in the main call ninjs
2015-04-15 21:38 <ninjs> so like {['1001','1002']: 'RTC'} ?
2015-04-15 21:38 <weaksauce> also {"1002' => "RTC", "1001" => "RTC" }
2015-04-15 21:38 <weaksauce> the keys need to be unique not the values
