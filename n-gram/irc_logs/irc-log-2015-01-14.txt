2015-01-14 00:20 <bradland> jordanm: ruby has two things that serve similar purposes to wheels
2015-01-14 00:20 <bradland> rubygems is the package distribution mechanism used by ruby
2015-01-14 00:21 <bradland> the packages are called gems, which can specify dependencies

2015-01-14 00:21 <bradland> ruby applications frequently rely on many gems, and often specific gem versions, but may not be actual gems themselves.
2015-01-14 00:22 <bradland> bundler is a tool for specifying the required gems and their associated versions.

2015-01-14 00:22 <workmad3> bradland: it looks like wheels is just a package installation and distribution system... so analogous to rubygems
2015-01-14 00:22 <jordanm> wheels can provide pre-compiled binaries for native modules. that was more what I was looking for
2015-01-14 00:22 <bradland> python separates package distribution and packaging
2015-01-14 00:23 <bradland> ok, in that case, not really

2015-01-14 02:40 <shevy> g-nom3
2015-01-14 02:40 <shevy> you should use a better pastie
2015-01-14 02:40 <shevy> this one you use has not even syntax colouring?
2015-01-14 02:41 <g-nom3> ok any suggestions?
2015-01-14 02:41 <shevy> both https://gist.github.com/ or http://pastie.org/ have syntax colouring
2015-01-14 02:41 <g-nom3> i also just realised i have do actions in there too which is incorrect
2015-01-14 02:41 <ericwood> I'd use a case statement
2015-01-14 02:41 <ericwood> and I'd also get rid of all of the "do" things...
2015-01-14 02:42 <g-nom3> ericwood: that makes sense

2015-01-14 02:42 <shevy> the "do/end" are not used with if conditionals g-nom3
2015-01-14 02:42 <ericwood> also, store the result in an ivar of some sort
2015-01-14 02:42 <ericwood> since this is THE canonical document you're working with from here on out
2015-01-14 02:42 <g-nom3> ok let me see if i can work out how thats done
2015-01-14 02:42 <ericwood> also this is a weird approach because the APIs for each of these gems is different
2015-01-14 02:42 <shevy> g-nom3 with do/end you must keep this in mind:

2015-01-14 02:47 <shevy> g-nom3 a big advantage when you use methods is that you can combine methods

2015-01-14 02:47 <shevy> like in a factory - one worker gives you some unfinished object, you process it further, then give it to the next guy in line. at the end, you have some finished product
2015-01-14 02:47 <g-nom3> that is fantastic shevy thank you.  elegant too.

2015-01-14 02:48 <shevy> dunno what your class really does, it seems to be just a wrapper over other APIs?
2015-01-14 02:48 <g-nom3> ah ok.. starting to make  a bit more sense now.  forgive me.  I'm what happens when a developer says you to a designer "you know you really should learn how to code"
2015-01-14 02:48 <ericwood> why not just call it Document and have a process method on it?
2015-01-14 02:49 <ericwood> ProcessDocument doesn't really semantically make sense
2015-01-14 02:49 <ericwood> the idea is you're wrapping multiple document formats and working on them via this class

2015-01-14 03:00 <postmodern> ericwood, the "failure" would just happen at a later point in the program
2015-01-14 03:01 <ericwood> ah I see
2015-01-14 03:01 <bradland> it depends on the context
2015-01-14 03:01 <bradland> is my life made harder by the op completing with the exception of the invalid record
2015-01-14 03:01 <postmodern> ericwood, say you have an array of records to parse, instead of raising a parse error on the first one, you parse and rescue the error, converting it to some InvalidRecord dummy object
2015-01-14 03:01 <bradland> or is it made more difficult

2015-01-14 06:08 <shevy> g-nom3 this is perfectly ok if you are sure you need these fields
2015-01-14 06:08 <shevy> the problem is that you gave them names
2015-01-14 06:09 <shevy> and that is not necessary because you have Array and Hash available, so you can store all of the latter in just either one of them, and access them

2015-01-14 07:04 <shevy> g-nom3 this is how you can use irb - you write a small test dataset into a .csv file. Then in irb, you load it up. Once you have the dataset, you can continue to manipulate it how you see fit. You just have to think in babysteps

2015-01-14 08:51 <shevy> g-nom3 the check: if __FILE__ == $PROGRAM_NAME  means that you can run it from the commandline
2015-01-14 08:51 <shevy> g-nom3 yes but you must provide an argument to that method
2015-01-14 08:51 <g-nom3> ah ten million thank you's!
2015-01-14 08:51 <shevy> g-nom3 that file also needs a require, I think. Roo is normally a constant not known to default ruby, you surely are using some addon
2015-01-14 08:52 <shevy> g-nom3 what also helps is to get a good editor
2015-01-14 08:52 <shevy> surely you must know CSS :)
2015-01-14 08:52 <g-nom3> i've got a great editor... emacs.. i know it well and yup i know css well too

2015-01-14 09:06 <agent_white> I'm not a good programmer by any means... and learning vim was easy for me. I don't understand why programmers seem to think it's hard, in any way.

2015-01-14 09:09 <epitron> g-nom3: you got some screencasts?

2015-01-14 09:11 <agent_white> epitron: Nope! Well, TBH, what got me really into the groove was vim-adventures since it taught me "hjkl". That's about it. Before then I still used vim, but used the arrow keys instead.
2015-01-14 09:11 <g-nom3> i'll take one.  btw org-mode sealed the deal with emacs.  i can't imagine life with out it
2015-01-14 09:11 <epitron> agent_white: so you guessed all the keys?
2015-01-14 09:11 <g-nom3> i don't really have the time to faff about with a screen cast as i must get this shiz done by the morning but i'll take a screenshot for sure

2015-01-14 09:14 <epitron> Yes, I agree

2015-01-14 13:07 <g-nom3> thank you for all your help anyways shevy.  i really appreciate it

2015-01-14 13:08 <ernetas> Hey guys.
2015-01-14 13:09 <shevy> g-nom3 well, for learning ruby, you actually chose a task of medium difficulty
2015-01-14 13:09 <shevy> so it's harder to progress through that
2015-01-14 13:09 <shevy> what may be much simpler is if you use ruby to manipulate/remove/copy files and directories
2015-01-14 13:09 <g-nom3> indeed.
2015-01-14 13:09 gr33n7007h has quit [Ping timeout: 256 seconds]
2015-01-14 13:10 <shevy> then you'll already have a bunch of things that you can use. for instance, block form of File.new('foo.txt') {|file| file.print 'hello world' }
2015-01-14 13:10 <ernetas> Any ideas why would delayed jobs would be running on 1 CPU cores' only? I'm running 24 processes (also, each one of them spawns 2 threads as by default) all running separate ruby interpereters,
2015-01-14 13:10 <ernetas> NUMA is enabled on the host.
2015-01-14 13:10 <shevy> g-nom3 and for instance, then you also will understand stuff like if __FILE__ == $PROGRAM_NAME, because you need that if you want to use a script from a commandline but also as a standalone library

2015-01-14 13:11 <shevy> g-nom3 I came from php so I wrote a lot of web-related code. ruby can do the same as php can though, much cleaner and shorter

2015-01-14 13:13 <g-nom3> yea the problem is i lack the foundation knowledge in programming principles too.  i used to do a lot with drupal and could fake my way through all the php stuff but yea, without the foundation knowledge it just makes things relatively impossible

2015-01-14 15:10 <Moter8> so... it's possibly a fish bug?

2015-01-14 15:10 <Moter8> okay, thanks for the help :)
2015-01-14 15:10 <workmad3> Moter8: it could be as simple as rbenv added itself to the PATH in a customisation of .bashrc, and you need to make a similar change in fish's equivalent ;)
2015-01-14 15:11 lampd1_ has joined #ruby
2015-01-14 15:11 <workmad3> Moter8: and then when you invoked fish from bash, fish picked up the modified PATH from bash running .bashrc or .bash_profile

2015-01-14 15:30 <omosoj> is there a shorthand to signify that you're talking about a method?
2015-01-14 15:30 <workmad3> omosoj: sometimes people use 'Class#method' yes
2015-01-14 15:31 <workmad3> I tend not to, because I can never remember if # is meant for a class method or an instance method :)

2015-01-14 15:35 <dman777_alter> I thought so...how can I check the difference?
2015-01-14 15:36 <dman777_alter> oh...olk
2015-01-14 15:36 <dman777_alter> ok
2015-01-14 15:36 <dman777_alter> thanks
2015-01-14 15:36 <workmad3> in the first instance, if you expect an array, treat it like one
2015-01-14 15:36 <workmad3> (duck-typing)
2015-01-14 15:36 <waxjar> in general you'd just check to see if an object responds to the methods you need to use
2015-01-14 15:36 <workmad3> if you absolutely must check for some reason, check .class
2015-01-14 15:36 <waxjar> or just use them without checking

2015-01-14 16:31 <shruggar> I would like to create an interactive (command-line) screen for selecting specific lines out of a file. For example, I am okay with having a menu-driven option for selecting files themselves, and when a file is selected, I want to show the file, as one might see in "less", with the added functionality of being able to "pick" lines from the file, in order to pass those lines on to the next stage of the program.      I really
2015-01-14 16:31 <shruggar>  don't want to re-implement all of "less", though, so I'm looking for anything which already provides similar functionality, and either does exactly what I want, or which can be easily extended.      I ask this in #ruby only because I'm writing the program in ruby so-far
2015-01-14 16:32 <shruggar> also I'm really bad at formulating concise questions

2015-01-14 16:33 <j2p2> so you want to be able to look at the cat'ed file and pick a line?
2015-01-14 16:33 <atmosx> shruggar: there's this program called 'vim'. If you add nerdtree (a plugin) I'm sure you get the same functionality.
2015-01-14 16:33 <j2p2> not programmatically, just looking at it and choosing?

2015-01-14 16:34 yokel has quit [Remote host closed the connection]
2015-01-14 16:34 <mostlybadfly> You could display line numbers next to each line and prompt for a number
2015-01-14 16:34 <mostlybadfly> That would seem fairly easy to implement

2015-01-14 16:34 <j2p2> ^ this is a good idea
2015-01-14 16:35 <atmosx> hm, seriously I don't think can be done beautifully without ncurses.

2015-01-14 16:36 <shruggar> I assume ncurses would be involved, I'm more thinking "is there anything which already uses ncurses and provides a bit of less-like functionality, and is extensible"   basically, a starting point slightly higher than ncurses
2015-01-14 16:37 <mostlybadfly> The ideal would be to be able to scroll and highlight each line and hit enter on the one you want

2015-01-14 16:38 <shruggar> mostlybadfly, that's exactly what I'm trying to get to.    I found a program called "iselect" which seems to be closest to what I want, but I haven't been able to find the source code (all links are broken) and has a couple of things on input lines which it interprets, while I would like to take the input "raw"
2015-01-14 16:38 <atmosx> a nice ncruses blue-black screen alla tmux session with the ability to keep tract of the selected lines, working with arrows and as mostlybadfly said hit 'space' or another predefined key to 'select' lines is what most people will think out of your desc shruggar
2015-01-14 16:38 <mostlybadfly> Hmmm I'm going to look at ncurses . don't really know about it tbh
2015-01-14 16:39 <mostlybadfly> This all is making me curious
2015-01-14 16:39 <atmosx> shruggar: I think once you figure out how to use ncurses, the rest will be fairly easy.

2015-01-14 16:39 <mostlybadfly> There is a gem or whatever
2015-01-14 16:39 <atmosx> shruggar: so just start playing around with them.

2015-01-14 16:44 <shruggar> vimscript is a nightmare, but implementing the basics prior to implementing "what I actually want" tends to be worse ;)

2015-01-14 18:22 <centrx> what does that scala do?
2015-01-14 18:22 <waxjar> i don't know any scala, but i think Array.new(x) { Foo.new(i) } comes close
2015-01-14 18:22 <centrx> is that like an Anumerator?
2015-01-14 18:22 <yjmsf20> basically, stuff will now be a Seq/List of Foo

2015-01-14 19:38 <bradland> so, when you run `bundle`, it’s finding it in /usr/local/bin

2015-01-14 19:38 <bradland> that’s his rvm info output
2015-01-14 19:38 <bradland> PATH is included
2015-01-14 19:39 <bradland> rvm comes first, but he didn’t have bundler installed in his RVM gems
2015-01-14 19:39 <bradland> so it was falling through to the one installed to /usr/local
2015-01-14 19:39 <Moter8> /bin:/usr/bin:/usr/local/bin

2015-01-14 19:40 <bradland> did you open a new shell?
2015-01-14 19:40 <bradland> because your `rvm info` output looks good
2015-01-14 19:40 <bradland> RVM requires that you add a line to your shell profile

2015-01-14 19:47 <bradland> this sounds like a recipe for disaster: “Since RVM is a large collection of bash scripts and fish is not bash-compatible, users of fish need a wrapper around RVM to make it work properly with that shell.”

2015-01-14 20:16 <bradland> regarding the headers, most rubygems packages don’t ship binaries
2015-01-14 20:16 <bradland> so you’ll need the headers to install lots of gems

2015-01-14 21:09 <bradland> so i kind of want to help the sanguinews guys out by fixing their bundler/gemspec dependency conflict situation.
2015-01-14 21:10 <bradland> it looks like their gemspec deps are properly separated: https://github.com/tdobrovolskij/sanguinews/blob/master/sanguinews.gemspec
2015-01-14 21:10 crack_user has joined #ruby
2015-01-14 21:10 <bradland> however, they have a Gemfile, which doesn’t use the gemspec directive: https://github.com/tdobrovolskij/sanguinews/blob/master/Gemfile
2015-01-14 21:10 <roqo> Is there a rails channel here?

2015-01-14 23:21 <bradland> conniemj: “dashboard” and “widgets” are two broad terms that don’t really have canonical definitions in Ruby that I’m aware of.
2015-01-14 23:21 <bradland> when you say dashboard, what kind of dashboard? an OS X dashboard widget?

2015-01-14 23:44 <terrellt> CrazyM4n: = isn't an operator, it's the suffix of a method.
2015-01-14 23:44 <CrazyM4n> Oh?
2015-01-14 23:44 <terrellt> CrazyM4n: Unless you mean like, def yo; b = c; end;

2015-01-14 23:48 <CrazyM4n> Sure, it's pointless, but that'd be kinda cool
