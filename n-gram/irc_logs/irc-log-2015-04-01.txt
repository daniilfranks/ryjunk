2015-04-01 09:11 <certainty> arup_r_: the problem is that @y doesn't exist until you invoke #another_var.
2015-04-01 09:12 <certainty> however you created the readers before that thus you only get a reader for every ivar that existed at that point
2015-04-01 09:12 <arup_r_> makes sesne

2015-04-01 09:31 <steven43126> Im trying to use ffi_lib to use a native extenstion bundled with a gem. Obviously the path to the extensions is different depending on rubygems version, OS, etc. Is there a way to deterine where a gems native extensions are placed ?
2015-04-01 09:31 <arup_r_> what should be the name of the method? https://gist.github.com/aruprakshit/76d9ed8b2fc16909e4ab#file-metaprogram-rb-L10 It is now working..

2015-04-01 09:32 <jhass> *dig
2015-04-01 09:33 <steven43126> jhass: looking thanks, the directory is present in the load_path added by bundler, so a require finds the native extensions but fails to load it as expected as it's meant to be used with ffi. ffi_lib it seems does not use the LOAD_PATH dirs during it's search

2015-04-01 10:01 <DeathCode> but the thing is ruby is set to v 1.9.3
2015-04-01 10:01 <DeathCode> rails is at v 4.2.1
2015-04-01 10:01 <sevenseacat> k?
2015-04-01 10:01 <DeathCode> how to update ruby to v 2.1.1
2015-04-01 10:01 <sevenseacat> you install that version of ruby.
2015-04-01 10:01 <DeathCode> ye installed
2015-04-01 10:01 <DeathCode> but cmd doesnt detect that
2015-04-01 10:01 <sevenseacat> no, you installed 1.9.3
2015-04-01 10:01 <DeathCode> when i do "ruby -v"
2015-04-01 10:02 <DeathCode> no i installed 2.2.1
2015-04-01 10:02 <adaedra> DeathCode: operating system?

2015-04-01 10:02 <DeathCode> windows*

2015-04-01 10:02 <DeathCode> ye
2015-04-01 10:02 <DeathCode> but then i installed 2.1.1

2015-04-01 10:04 <adaedra> Try having a clean, single installation of ruby.
2015-04-01 10:04 <DeathCode> how to uninstall
2015-04-01 10:04 <adaedra> Or use things like rvm, althrough I don’t know if it works with Windows.
2015-04-01 10:04 <sevenseacat> it doesnt
2015-04-01 10:04 <DeathCode> ye rvm i was thinking
2015-04-01 10:04 <DeathCode> oh no? ok
2015-04-01 10:04 <adaedra> If you went through installer, Control panel is the place to look.
2015-04-01 10:04 <sevenseacat> afaik
2015-04-01 10:05 <workmad3> you might be able to get RVM or similar working with something like cygwin that provides a shell that's more like bash
2015-04-01 10:05 <workmad3> but it would take a lot of effort and windows know-how, and I'm not certain you'd be able to do it (or how stable it would be if you did)

2015-04-01 11:15 <unshadow> Hi guys, I need some advice, I created a proxy which does URL rewrite using data.gsub, what is the overhead of gsub ? is there a better why to manipulate the data so it will be faster (or consume less resources) ? thanks

2015-04-01 11:33 <jhass> hs366: if you rely on the non-existing index returning nil there, another common and possibly more robust approach is to check the arrays .size

2015-04-01 13:26 <thebatu1> lets say in this context """ product.posters << create(:poster, product: product) """" ?

2015-04-01 13:28 <thebatu1> this code is taken from a factoryGirl code
2015-04-01 13:28 <bradland> ok, so product is probably an ActiveRecord query result, and posters is an association, which would also make it an ActiveRecord object
2015-04-01 13:28 <bradland> that's a guess though
2015-04-01 13:29 <bradland> you can know for sure by logging the output of 'product.posters.inspect' just before that line

2015-04-01 14:52 <Tomasso> hey I get a json via rest client api, and there is one spanish word for example "opción" , the thing is that I got it as "opci\xE2\x94\x9C\xE2\x94\x82n"    and there are manymany examples like that, my json parsing is failiing and I think is due to that. I try to autodetect encoding pasting text on the internet and it say KO :S what should i do ?

2015-04-01 14:54 <bradland> When you say "I get a json via rest client api", who controls this API? They should tell you the text encoding you expect.
2015-04-01 14:54 <bradland> Rather than guessing.
2015-04-01 14:54 agrinb has joined #ruby
2015-04-01 14:54 <bradland> Guessing at text encoding is difficult.
2015-04-01 14:54 <Tomasso> bradland: the problem is that i control it myself xD
2015-04-01 14:54 <bradland> haha, ok
2015-04-01 14:55 haxrbyte has quit [Remote host closed the connection]
2015-04-01 14:55 <bradland> so what you need to do is make your encoding consistent throughout the application
2015-04-01 14:55 vyorkin has joined #ruby
2015-04-01 14:55 <bradland> UTF-8 is recommended in most cases.
2015-04-01 14:55 <bradland> you start at the client and work your way up through the stack.
2015-04-01 14:55 <Tomasso> yeahh,, gotta check that..

2015-04-01 17:19 <benjwadams> Hi, I inherited a legacy rails app that works with a lot of observation data.  Most of our stack is python and uses numpy and pandas and the like for data analysis on the backend.  Does ruby have any libraries filling a similar niche?

2015-04-01 18:09 <bradland> i prefer the term associate with hash key values because map has such a specific meaning in ruby
2015-04-01 18:09 <jhass> the general name for that datastructure across languages is in fact Map
2015-04-01 18:09 postmodern has joined #ruby
2015-04-01 18:09 <jhass> ah, good point I guess
2015-04-01 18:09 <sandelius> if you remove template rendering and use ruby just as a json api it's pretty darn fast :)
2015-04-01 18:10 <bradland> PHP has "associative arrays", which look similar as well
2015-04-01 18:10 <apeiros> and rubys implementation is a hash map
2015-04-01 18:10 <Ellis> so in hashes the key is more than just a location
2015-04-01 18:10 <apeiros> bradland: not sure php's associative arrays are actually hash maps.
2015-04-01 18:10 <bradland> they're not
2015-04-01 18:10 <bradland> they just look similar
2015-04-01 18:10 <bradland> Ellis: you have to be careful about saying "location"
2015-04-01 18:10 shadoi1 has joined #ruby
2015-04-01 18:10 <bradland> because it implies order
2015-04-01 18:11 <hanmac> Ellis: in ruby a key in a Hash can litteraly be anything ... even the object itself ;P
2015-04-01 18:11 <bradland> ruby is convenient, because it's Hashes are ordered.
2015-04-01 18:11 <sandelius> I've always wondered why PHP (Rasmus) chose to combine array and hash into "associative array"
2015-04-01 18:11 <hanmac> >> a = {}; a[a] = a; a
2015-04-01 18:11 <eval-in_> hanmac => {{...}=>{...}} (https://eval.in/307724)
2015-04-01 18:11 <bradland> but as a general construct, hash maps are not ordered.
2015-04-01 18:11 MatthewsFace has quit [Remote host closed the connection]
2015-04-01 18:11 <bradland> or rather, not assumed to be ordered
2015-04-01 18:11 <agarie> well, I guess it just turned out like that (like most of PHP)
2015-04-01 18:11 <havenn> >> a = {}; a[a] = a; a.sort
2015-04-01 18:11 <eval-in_> havenn => [[{{...}=>{...}}, {{...}=>{...}}]] (https://eval.in/307725)
2015-04-01 18:11 <apeiros> eh, right. since 1.9 I should not say "hash map" but "ordered hash map"
2015-04-01 18:11 <jhass> I guess we're going way over Ellis head right now :)
2015-04-01 18:12 <bradland> yeah, sorry ellis
2015-04-01 18:12 <bradland> from a practical perspective, think of a hash as a way to define keys and values, which are associated
2015-04-01 18:12 <jhass> Ellis: don't worry too much, it'll click once you use them and maybe one or two times somebody points out "use the other one instead"

2015-04-01 18:22 <jhass> you write a dictionary program, the user can enter a keyword and you display its definition
2015-04-01 18:22 <jhass> if you stored your dictionary in an Array, where would you get the index from?

2015-04-01 18:25 <Ellis> so if i had  a blog site, could i create a hash with a key called :health, and that corresponds to a tag so when people search the tag they get all the blog posts that are associated with that key
2015-04-01 18:25 <jhass> Ellis: yeah, if you use any of the examples we've done so far we will come and make you fail the assignment :P
2015-04-01 18:25 <Ellis> apeiros: i dont really care about the assignment, i just want to clarify this stuff

2015-04-01 19:23 <mcpierce> Hi, all. I have a question. I'm working on a Ruby extension and in the C code I tuck away an object in a Ruby Hash using a key created with rb_str_new.
2015-04-01 19:24 ping-pong has joined #ruby
2015-04-01 19:24 <mcpierce> Later when I try to get that object back from the same hash (I've verified the hash has the object) using another call to rb_str_new I'm getting back Qnil.

2015-04-01 21:37 <jhass> afaik
2015-04-01 21:38 <wallerdev> yeah i think it's always capitalized
2015-04-01 21:38 <shevy> hmm. that would also mean one would have to write  "Brunzlbrecher is a German beer" would also be capitalized
