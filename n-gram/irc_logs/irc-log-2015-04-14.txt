2015-04-14 00:11 <Kendro> Radar, Thank you. Do you believe learning Ruby will be much time consuming if having previous experience in programming, C++ ?
2015-04-14 00:11 <Radar> Nope. You should pick it up fairly easy.
2015-04-14 00:12 <Radar> You might think "look at all the things I am not typing!"

2015-04-14 00:15 <Kendro> Are you sure that's all I need? I mean I'm used to in depth learning like theory of constructors/initialization and such.
2015-04-14 00:15 <Andoriyu> two arrays, one has hashes, another one integers. Need to remove all hashes where one specific key is included in the second array. Is there faster way then Array#reject?
2015-04-14 00:15 <Kendro> No idea if there is any need for such in Ruby.
2015-04-14 00:16 <dodobrain> Kendro, if you are familiar with C++ it should be easy enough to pick up just looking at the '20-min tutorial' on ruby-lang.org and then also reading the 'Ruby from another language' pages also on ruby-lang.org

2015-04-14 01:53 <Radar> Did you try googling that exact question?
2015-04-14 01:53 <zachrab> yes
2015-04-14 01:53 <centrx> You can have the job output to a log file e.g. with >

2015-04-14 02:45 <bintelli> Does anyone have experience with the Twitter gem? I'm trying to pass in two arguments (one instance variable and one a string) as a single query for the text field. e.g. @client.search(@instance variable && "text")

2015-04-14 02:47 <sevenseacat> thats not how you concatenate strings in ruby
2015-04-14 02:47 <shevy> bintelli you could do + if both are strings, or .concat() or .to_s
2015-04-14 02:47 <shevy> bintelli the @instance_variable you use is a string already right?
2015-04-14 02:48 <bintelli> yes

2015-04-14 06:17 allenn has joined #ruby
2015-04-14 06:18 <shevy> vulix depends a lot on the gem; if it is pure ruby, it should work flawlessly if you adhere to good-use-practice
2015-04-14 06:18 <SpicyMagpie> vulix, if you are on Windows and your machines are Linux, it will never be the same env.
2015-04-14 06:18 <shevy> if it requires compilation, then things may be a bit trickier, but you can also compile on windows
2015-04-14 06:18 <shevy> like the cygwin/msys environment or other setups

2015-04-14 06:19 <shevy> vulix what kind of project do you have in mind that you wish to develop/deploy from windows?
2015-04-14 06:19 <shevy> yeah games such as "catch the mouse!" or "swim in the ocean!"

2015-04-14 06:19 <shevy> what are the seven seas anyway
2015-04-14 06:20 <shevy> fancy features huh

2015-04-14 06:20 <vulix> Tbh I do a lot of data science stuff in Java and Python. There are some great libraries but I want to develop my own hobby package in another language to actually implement some algorithms myself and learn. Hard to do it in Py and Java because there's already so many great packages already, so I'm not incentivized to do it there

2015-04-14 06:29 <SpicyMagpie> great!
2015-04-14 06:30 <hanmac1> i also had a ruby binding for Ogre3d but thats much older

2015-04-14 06:35 <SpicyMagpie> sounds fun
2015-04-14 06:36 <SpicyMagpie> why not starting with stencyl/construct2 before? seems much more achievable.
2015-04-14 06:36 <dodobrain> why do i need 'bundle exec rake db:migrate' instead of simply 'rake db:migrate' ?

2015-04-14 06:39 <SpicyMagpie> and I was unaware about wxRuby's painful death. what happened? gone for my tea!
2015-04-14 06:39 <dodobrain> umm.. rake is a shellscript right? and i have the correct one in my PATH and in it in the header it refers to the correct version of ruby too
2015-04-14 06:40 <dodobrain> sevenseacat, so if i'm using chruby, i should be able to simply do rake db:migrate and get the same result, right?
2015-04-14 06:40 <havenwood> dodobrain: what happens if you omit the `bundle exec` prefix?
2015-04-14 06:40 <sevenseacat> no
2015-04-14 06:40 <sevenseacat> well, yes, as long as you only have one version of every gem installed

2015-04-14 06:40 <SpicyMagpie> dodobrain, you "can" do rake db:migrate. It's just not a good practice to do it in case you do something wrong.
2015-04-14 06:41 <sevenseacat> most of the time, it will work fine. sometimes, it will explode in weird and wonderful ways.
2015-04-14 06:41 work has left #ruby ["Leaving"]
2015-04-14 06:41 <dodobrain> havenwood, it just works because i did a ruby-install, chruby, thingy..
2015-04-14 06:41 <dodobrain> no i guess i should really know: what does 'bundle' actually do?
2015-04-14 06:41 <dodobrain> s/no/now
2015-04-14 06:42 <sevenseacat> only loads those gems which are part of your Gemfile.
2015-04-14 06:42 Asher has joined #ruby
2015-04-14 06:42 <sevenseacat> so you can safely have 45 different versions of rails installed, but you'll only use the one thats in your Gemfile.
2015-04-14 06:43 <havenwood> dodobrain: If you want to have it work automagically you can install the rubygems-bundler gem, but you prefix `bundle exec` to use the exact gems specified in your Gemfile.lock.
2015-04-14 06:43 <havenwood> dodobrain: http://bundler.io/
2015-04-14 06:43 <dodobrain> i know Gemfile lists gems that are needed (along with minimum version sometimes), Gemfile.lock lists the exact versions that were installed. 'bundle install' can be used to install the gems listed in Gemfile, 'bundle update' will update the gems and if necessary update Gemfile.lock as well

2015-04-14 06:44 <dodobrain> ok, good. so once again what does 'bundle exec abcd' do over simply 'abcd' ?
2015-04-14 06:45 <Radar> Runs abcd in the context of the bundle
2015-04-14 06:45 juanpablo____ has joined #ruby
2015-04-14 06:45 <sevenseacat> how many times do we have to say the same thing? if you have an issue with the explanations we've given, tell us what the problem is, instead of just asking the same questionsd over and over
2015-04-14 06:45 <havenwood> dodobrain: `abcd` doesn't use Bundler at all while `bundle exec abcd` runs the command with the gems in the Gemfile.lock.

2015-04-14 06:49 <SpicyMagpie> hanmac1, nobody had replicas?

2015-04-14 08:22 <ParmesanCaesar> lol ok

2015-04-14 08:22 <heftig> unless you're golfing
2015-04-14 08:23 <jhass> evaluation is right to left, parenthesis can only override operator precedence
2015-04-14 08:23 <jhass> er, left to right
2015-04-14 08:23 * jhass needs to fully wake up
2015-04-14 08:23 <adaedra> but yeah, your statement may need some rewrite, because it is hard to see what is executed

2015-04-14 08:24 SpicyMagpie has joined #ruby
2015-04-14 08:24 <jhass> since .chomp raises when gets returns nil

2015-04-14 08:59 <vulix> Does anyone have some words of wisdom or anything to convince me to go ahead and dive into Ruby vs the alternatives? :P
2015-04-14 08:59 <vulix> I already know Python and Perl but bored of them, not sure if Ruby's worth picking up
2015-04-14 08:59 <sevenseacat> every language is worth picking up.

2015-04-14 09:00 <sevenseacat> yes.
2015-04-14 09:00 <vulix> Mostly Java (which, JRuby is appealing to me.)

2015-04-14 09:03 <sevenseacat> its a little bad because not many ruby programmers use windows. them's the breaks.
2015-04-14 09:03 <sevenseacat> it still works perfectly well.
2015-04-14 09:03 <sevenseacat> just not as well as on other OSes.
2015-04-14 09:03 * canton7 has never had a problem with ruby + windows
2015-04-14 09:04 <hanmac1> Vulix: Windows support is always bad ;P
2015-04-14 09:04 <vulix> Yeah I understand. I'm not Windows-only but it's nice to be able to actually port my project to wherever and work from there
2015-04-14 09:04 <sevenseacat> so... what exactly is stopping you?
2015-04-14 09:04 <vulix> Java is oddly the easiest to work with IMO on Windows, aside form .net stuff

2015-04-14 09:09 <sevenseacat> i know, it sucks to have to rely on an installer to install a language.

2015-04-14 09:10 <sevenseacat> yes.
2015-04-14 09:10 <vulix> or is it the same situation where you wait for a package

2015-04-14 10:11 <Mon_Ouie> The phrase "hex bytes" makes no sense. Ruby just writes "K" because the byte at this location represents "K" in ASCII

2015-04-14 13:51 <n4do> http://learnrubythehardway.org/book/ex23.html
2015-04-14 13:51 <n4do> any ideas what code to read?

2015-04-14 13:54 <n4do_> okay. Thanks for the advice mikecmpbll
2015-04-14 13:54 <casshern2> I am following a very simple example how to calculate BMI but it doesnt work, even though my code is identical
2015-04-14 13:54 sarumon has left #ruby [#ruby]
2015-04-14 13:54 <casshern2> it only works when I convert the numbers to integers for some reason, otherwise it just gives me a wrong total https://gist.github.com/Luomint/669962b3f25d068cb2cf
2015-04-14 13:55 <avril14th> Casshern2: you need to cast I float as think

2015-04-14 13:56 <mikecmpbll> n4do_: choose an idea that you want to implement and just attack it. you'll end up reading other code and understanding it as part of the process of finding out how to something that you need for your own app, and you'll understand it more thoroughly
2015-04-14 13:56 <casshern2> this one https://youtu.be/hcdx6z643lk?t=4m41s
2015-04-14 13:56 <mikecmpbll> (because you have to, to implement it yourself)
2015-04-14 13:57 <n4do_> okay
2015-04-14 13:57 <mikecmpbll> Casshern2: the code in the example converts to integer too
2015-04-14 13:58 <casshern2> hmm but it says to_i

2015-04-14 13:58 <mikecmpbll> yeah, that is a conversion to integer.

2015-04-14 13:59 <casshern2> yea I am saying the code doesnt work as it tis
2015-04-14 13:59 <casshern2> only when I change it to floats to_f
2015-04-14 13:59 <mikecmpbll> [14:54:33]  <Casshern2>	it only works when I convert the numbers to integers for some reason

2015-04-14 16:48 <jhass> well, you asked #ruby and not #vagrant, so I assumed you're interested in learning Ruby. Working with arrays is one of the first things you learn, so I'd also assume you know enough about them to recognize ARGV behaves like one. So treating it like one there too is indeed something easy and quick to try out

2015-04-14 17:18 <Hounddog> xxneolithicxx: i did that but this created a whole different set of problems for ansible. The inventory would only contain the namespace currently provided as vagrant does not "know" any other machine anymore
2015-04-14 17:19 <pagios> jhass: refering to this http://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdkforruby/api/Aws/SNS/Client.html i see message: "message"
2015-04-14 17:19 <pagios> not json so i am congused
2015-04-14 17:19 <xxneolithicxx> Hounddog: if you do it that way and then someone provides a machine name to vagrant as well, then it ignores all other machines you defined and only processes the action against that explicit machine

2015-04-14 17:22 <Hounddog> xxneolithicxx: vagrant.d is not the issue i have there
2015-04-14 17:22 <pagios> so mainly message-strcture is the "message"

2015-04-14 17:46 <Na_Klar> actually this not true: within the while loop there is a system call. So the ctrl+c gets passthoughed to the system call, and that gets killed. so the ruby script will not get killed ... hm ...

2015-04-14 19:46 <jhass> 3 + 2 is 5, 5 - 7 is -2, so 5 < -2 returns true, since -2 is lower than 5

2015-04-14 20:12 <Scriptonaut> this might be more of a rails question, but I figure I'll ask here. I have a module in the lib directory. Normally I can access this module jsut fine, initialize it (set an instance variable), and call its methods. However, when I make it a delayed_job, it's like every time a job executes it's redefining my module from the module file. So then I have to initialize it every time

2015-04-14 20:22 <Scriptonaut> the background job is like re-reading the module file to define it every single time
2015-04-14 20:22 <jhass> sohrab: oh, you have multiple inputs need the unique substrings across all inputs and in which inputs they appear?

2015-04-14 20:23 <sohrab> my solution was to put fragments in a hash; if one already exists, delete it and put the fragment in an array of duplicates. so for each string i (a) check duplicate array, and (b) check the hash.
2015-04-14 20:24 <atmosx> Scriptonaut: delayed job is supposed to work like that. I used sidekick, not delayed_job but it's kinda the same

2015-04-14 20:24 <sohrab> jhass: yes, i think that's it. a file with many lines of strings is the input. sorry for the confusion
2015-04-14 20:24 <Scriptonaut> just define a function somewhere that calls it

2015-04-14 20:26 <jhass> sohrab: then I'd do a Hash.new {|h, k| h[k] = [] } instead of a Set with the fragment as key and the original strings as values
2015-04-14 20:26 <jhass> or a set as value actually to eliminate duplicates there
2015-04-14 20:26 <jhass> so the loop can just unconditionally fragments[fragment] << original

2015-04-14 21:17 <Scriptonaut> I'll just reinitialize each time and take the performance hit
2015-04-14 21:17 <atmosx> I see
2015-04-14 21:17 <Scriptonaut> the next project I have to implement this on uses sidekiq
2015-04-14 21:17 <Scriptonaut> so that will be nice

2015-04-14 21:21 <Scriptonaut> ya
2015-04-14 21:21 <atmosx> Scriptonaut: read :-P https://github.com/collectiveidea/delayed_job
2015-04-14 21:21 <Scriptonaut> just define a variable in there?
2015-04-14 21:21 <Scriptonaut> I did read that
2015-04-14 21:21 <Scriptonaut> I have that file, but I mean right now I'm defining it in it's own initializer
2015-04-14 21:21 <atmosx> Yes
2015-04-14 21:21 <Scriptonaut> all initializers are run at the same scope arne't hey?

2015-04-14 21:22 <Scriptonaut> then ya, it won't make a difference if I reference the module in there or a different initializer like I'm doing now
2015-04-14 21:22 <Scriptonaut> I wonder if it's just in development that it does this
2015-04-14 21:22 <Scriptonaut> reloads the module for every job
2015-04-14 21:22 <Scriptonaut> and in production it loads it once, that way you can make changes on the fly
2015-04-14 21:22 <atmosx> oh, that sounds reasonable.

2015-04-14 22:01 <jhass> +1, sounds like what S3 was made for
2015-04-14 22:01 <xploshioon> i was thinking in heroku with some add ons for the files, but heroku with 1gb ram is 30$ for month.. even a vps in DO can be better with less money
2015-04-14 22:01 <jhass> you can always move away when it gets less expensive to run your own DC
2015-04-14 22:02 <jhass> yeah, DO or Linode for the appservers and S3 for storage

2015-04-14 22:03 <weaksauce> From what I hear S3 actually wasn't intended to serve things up and it gets expensive. the S3 to store them longer term and then CDN that amazon has to actually serve them is more up your alley.

2015-04-14 22:08 <xploshioon> ill see what's the price and see what's the best choice

2015-04-14 22:44 <shevy> because php python lua perl ruby, it's all really the same family
2015-04-14 22:44 <shevy> though PHP is more of a pot for cooking than for programming
2015-04-14 22:44 <Secnz> So you do talk about dynamically typed languages
2015-04-14 22:44 <Secnz> Aight
2015-04-14 22:45 <ProteusX> a pot for cooking? :)
2015-04-14 22:45 <shevy> dunno... "typing/typed" is a bit weird
2015-04-14 22:45 <shevy> >> "my string".is_a? String
2015-04-14 22:45 <ProteusX> more like a crack pot for smoking crack :D
2015-04-14 22:45 <Secnz> Any other book than TWGR you would suggest_

2015-04-14 22:45 <Secnz> ?
2015-04-14 22:45 <ProteusX> wait, crack pipe, is what I meant :)
2015-04-14 22:45 <shevy> optional typing would be nice though

2015-04-14 22:46 <Secnz> looks really weird :P

2015-04-14 22:47 <shevy> you just get "true" back
2015-04-14 22:47 <shevy> ruby is essentially a simple language, even though it has a lot of stuff
2015-04-14 22:47 <siaw23> can someone please tell me what the “*” sign is doing in front of the method argument? https://gist.github.com/siaw23/12f6c1086fde5df42b41

2015-04-14 22:48 <shevy> siaw23 so you see, you can call that method

2015-04-14 22:48 <siaw23> not outside

2015-04-14 22:50 <Secnz> I have seen that you can use printf in Ruby. Is it preferred?
2015-04-14 22:50 <siaw23> and he’s doing that with all the operator
2015-04-14 22:50 <siaw23> % / ^ etc
2015-04-14 22:50 <shevy> perhaps he does it just because he can
2015-04-14 22:50 <shevy> yeah, ok

2015-04-14 22:52 <Secnz> weaksauce: What comes after?
2015-04-14 22:52 <shevy> siaw23 so that he can use all those method calls:    ^ / %
2015-04-14 22:52 <shevy> rabbit = Rabbit.new

2015-04-14 22:52 <shevy> rabbit % 5

2015-04-14 22:53 <weaksauce> Secnz the docs mainly. that will not teach you ruby it teaches you best practices and more advanced stuff. TWGR teaches you ruby as a language.
2015-04-14 22:53 <Secnz> I mainly want to learn Ruby for RoR, don't know if that's a good enough reason to do so.

2015-04-14 23:27 <FrankD> Does anyone know how I might go about redirecting IO from say executing bash.. so I could have a terminal in a browser? I realize that there's things I'd have to set like term -- and is there a way to deal with all the term-y kinda stuff that can happen? ie loading a text editor (nano, vi, whatever)
2015-04-14 23:27 <FrankD> i thought there might be a library for something like that

2015-04-14 23:50 <Secnz> so
2015-04-14 23:50 <Secnz> def name; @name; end; is same as doing public: string name() { return name_; } private: string name_;
