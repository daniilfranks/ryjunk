2015-04-10 00:02 <Senjai> and its easy

2015-04-10 00:04 <Senjai> So is Node, actually
2015-04-10 00:04 <Senjai> but if you like Ruby, just stick with Ruby, seriously

2015-04-10 02:04 <martin290> so, i came here because.. i've been learning c#
2015-04-10 02:05 <martin290> and i heard that ruby is a really good language
2015-04-10 02:05 <martin290> was wondering if you (or anyone else here) knows both, and which one they prefer coding in?

2015-04-10 02:26 <sevenseacat> we generally are, unless people come in who just dont want to learn or dont care
2015-04-10 02:26 <sevenseacat> then we get snarky

2015-04-10 02:27 <martin290> and one person was like.... why don't you read the f'ing documentation
2015-04-10 02:28 <weaksauce> martin290 don't worry
2015-04-10 02:28 <martin290> or something along those lines...
2015-04-10 02:28 <weaksauce> rubyist wont tell you that

2015-04-10 06:34 <pagios_> is function1 blocking in this case?

2015-04-10 06:35 <sevenseacat> yes, i know.
2015-04-10 06:35 <pagios_> how do i do that in ruby
2015-04-10 06:35 codecop has joined #ruby
2015-04-10 06:35 <sevenseacat> you're overcomplicating this.
2015-04-10 06:35 <sevenseacat> its how ruby works by default.
2015-04-10 06:36 <pagios_> so it is synchronous only execute function2 after function1 returns
2015-04-10 06:36 <sevenseacat> its how javascript works too, unless you get into asynchronous things.
2015-04-10 06:36 <pagios_> yea
2015-04-10 06:36 <pagios_> with callbacks
2015-04-10 06:37 <sevenseacat> however, you've made no mention of having asynchronisity anywhere
2015-04-10 06:37 <pagios_> so ruby will block all code in this thread until function1 returns
2015-04-10 06:37 <sevenseacat> so its how things work by default.
2015-04-10 06:37 <pagios_> ok

2015-04-10 07:26 <demiurgen> how exactly is the thread scheduling working in ruby? it seems to me that if I start a thread in some script, and the run a long, blocking operation in the main script, then the thread will not execute for the duration of that blocking operation. is this correct?

2015-04-10 07:30 <demiurgen> what's my best option to start some ruby code block as a separate process?
2015-04-10 07:30 <jhass> fork
2015-04-10 07:31 <jhass> also check jruby & rubinious for implementations without that restriction
2015-04-10 07:32 <pagios_> how can i read that in ruby? http://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdkforruby/api/Aws/PageableResponse.html
2015-04-10 07:32 <demiurgen> note that my code runs through cucumber, which probably does a lot of crazy stuff, so we'll see how well fork() works
2015-04-10 07:33 <pagios_> thats a response i am receiving from amazon

2015-04-10 11:51 <freestyl3r> hello, i was wondering if there is a way to assign a value to an object attribute through C in a native extension
2015-04-10 11:52 <freestyl3r> i can use  rb_eval_string("n.word = 'test'"); but maybe there is something cleaner?
2015-04-10 11:52 <freestyl3r> i can read the value, i just don't know how to write to it. VALUE test = rb_funcall(n, rb_intern("word"), 0);

2015-04-10 14:26 <nickjj> but 4k at 200% scaling is the same PPI as 1080p i think, so if linux can scale it well it should look nice
2015-04-10 14:26 <Pharaoh2> even windows doesn't support it properly
2015-04-10 14:26 <Pharaoh2> there is a difference between the os scaling and the apps actually supporting it
2015-04-10 14:27 <nickjj> i'm not sure i would depend on apps supporting it

2015-04-10 15:42 <jhass> no

2015-04-10 15:43 <apeiros> GaryOak_: methods and variables are two fundamentally different things
2015-04-10 15:43 Megtastique has joined #ruby
2015-04-10 15:43 <apeiros> you don't call a variable. and @ivar is a variable.
2015-04-10 15:43 <apeiros> attr_reader also does *not* define a variable. it defines a method.

2015-04-10 15:48 <apeiros> care to be more specific?
2015-04-10 15:49 <apeiros> or do you expect me to go through the whole code line by line?
2015-04-10 15:49 <GaryOak_> so on line 9 I'm calling puts my_ivar and it outputs "testing"
2015-04-10 15:49 <apeiros> GaryOak_: tell me, does `my_ivar` have an @ in front of it?
2015-04-10 15:49 <GaryOak_> no
2015-04-10 15:49 <GaryOak_> not in that method
2015-04-10 15:49 <apeiros> so you know it's not an instance variable

2015-04-10 15:51 msnyon has joined #ruby
2015-04-10 15:51 <apeiros> no. @@var are class variables
2015-04-10 15:51 <GaryOak_> ok so it's a local var
2015-04-10 15:51 <apeiros> that would be possible from the syntax
2015-04-10 15:51 One-Sky has joined #ruby
2015-04-10 15:52 <GaryOak_> Or is it a method call?
2015-04-10 15:52 agarie has quit [Remote host closed the connection]
2015-04-10 15:52 <apeiros> but from the context, you can see that nowhere in the method speak is an lvar named `my_ivar` assigned
2015-04-10 15:52 <apeiros> so from the context, you also know it can't be a local variable. a local variable always requires an assignment first.
2015-04-10 15:52 One-Sky has quit [Max SendQ exceeded]
2015-04-10 15:52 <apeiros> yes. method call is the only other option besides local variable.
2015-04-10 15:52 <apeiros> now the question is, where is the method `my_ivar` defined and what does it do?
2015-04-10 15:52 One-Sky has joined #ruby
2015-04-10 15:53 <GaryOak_> it's defined by the attr_reader
2015-04-10 15:53 <apeiros> correct
2015-04-10 15:53 allenn has quit [Remote host closed the connection]
2015-04-10 15:53 <apeiros> and as jhass said before, `attr_reader :my_ivar` is short for `def my_ivar; return @my_ivar; end`
2015-04-10 15:54 <apeiros> does that answer why `my_ivar` (the method call) evaluates to the same value as `@my_ivar` (an instance variable lookup)?
2015-04-10 15:54 <GaryOak_> phew yes thank you

2015-04-10 15:55 jimms has joined #ruby
2015-04-10 15:55 <GaryOak_> otherwise you are just calling the method
2015-04-10 15:55 <apeiros> you can't write to an instance variable from the outside without going throug a method
2015-04-10 15:55 <apeiros> note that "change ivars value" can mean two things:
2015-04-10 15:56 <apeiros> a) assign a different object
2015-04-10 15:56 <apeiros> b) mutate the currently assigned object

2015-04-10 15:57 <GaryOak_> I've just seen code where they read instance vars without the @, but now it makes sense

2015-04-10 18:47 <mdcox> jhass: I'm not sure, I haven't looked too much into it.  I just assume things like say, split() on a string probably isn't built into the interpreter....I could be wrong though.  I haven't put too much thought into it.

2015-04-10 22:19 <undeadaedra> you create a struct with Name = Struct.new(:a, :b)
2015-04-10 22:19 <undeadaedra> This creates a sort of template of variable composed of fields a and b

2015-04-10 22:21 <jhass> Ellis: you can skip over them for now. In Ruby Struct is just a shorthand to write a class that does nothing but contain a few attributes. Somebody might nitpick you for writing such a class instead of using Struct, but that's all
2015-04-10 22:22 <Ellis> undeadaedra: ty for explaining it i appreciate it

2015-04-10 23:05 <dudedudeman> hi beauties
2015-04-10 23:05 <dudedudeman> question
2015-04-10 23:05 <dudedudeman> where does my has_many relationship go? I'm assuming not in my migrations class?
2015-04-10 23:05 <dudedudeman> i'm working on a project outside of rails that uses activerecord
2015-04-10 23:06 <ramfjord> hey babe
2015-04-10 23:06 <ramfjord> still put it in your activerecord class
2015-04-10 23:06 <dudedudeman> i've created my two migrations, now i'm just looking to fill them out properly so I can run rake db:migrate

2015-04-10 23:06 <mozzarella> in your models
2015-04-10 23:06 <dudedudeman> ah. ok ok. this makes sense
2015-04-10 23:06 <ramfjord> if you're still using activerecord, don't you still have class Blah < ActiveRecord::Base?
2015-04-10 23:07 <dudedudeman> umm, yes, but I believe I'm just a step before that. i'm setting up my migrations now
2015-04-10 23:07 <dudedudeman> i haven't actually run rake db:migrate yet
2015-04-10 23:07 <dudedudeman> just rake db:create_migrations

2015-04-10 23:18 tosbourn has quit [Ping timeout: 250 seconds]

2015-04-10 23:18 michael_mbp has joined #ruby
2015-04-10 23:19 <Ellis> matugm: so insteead of using an alternative, most ppl use yml because it is human readable?

2015-04-10 23:20 <matugm> Yeah

2015-04-10 23:23 <weaksauce> the table at the top shows you exactly what methods get created when you put has_many or whatever in your class
2015-04-10 23:24 <bricker> Ellis: yes
2015-04-10 23:24 <weaksauce> and the others part should be explained a little better
2015-04-10 23:24 <Ellis> thanks
2015-04-10 23:24 <matugm> Ellis, config/database.yml and config/secret.yml are two examples of yml files in Rails
2015-04-10 23:25 <weaksauce> basically others is whatever relationship you define. so has_many :calibrations would give you calibrations.count calibrations.delete etc.

2015-04-10 23:49 <weaksauce> you don't have to use the generators/scaffolding to get work done in rails and when you do that it tells you exactly what it's doing anyway. :)
2015-04-10 23:49 <dudedudeman> i'll sign on later after doing some more work

2015-04-10 23:51 <pipework> weaksauce: Don't back down on backups.
2015-04-10 23:51 <dudedudeman> i use cloud9 for my development environment, and have backups of that as well. so, it would take a couple major failures to lose my stuff. and github

2015-04-10 23:52 <pipework> Fascinating.
2015-04-10 23:53 <dudedudeman> cloud9?

2015-04-10 23:53 <pipework> correct
2015-04-10 23:53 <dudedudeman> ah. Well, here's why i use it
2015-04-10 23:55 <dudedudeman> i get downtime at work when i can work on code, which is great. however, i'm on a fedora box that is locked down by my sysadmin(typical). i use cloud9 because i get an ubuntu box with full sudo privileges that i can access through chrome without having to bug my sysadmin every time i need something downloaded or installed

2015-04-10 23:55 <terrellt> Not a developer?
2015-04-10 23:55 <terrellt> A full time paid developer*
2015-04-10 23:55 <dudedudeman> and when i work at home, it's seamless. the same things i was staring at before leaving the office are there right for me when i get home
2015-04-10 23:56 <dudedudeman> no, i am not. that is my current goal/dream/passion in life. to get a full time job doing that
2015-04-10 23:56 <pipework> dudedudeman: Hm, I can understand that a bit. I just would rather have a more local scene. If you had ssh, you could carry around a VM in your pocket.
2015-04-10 23:56 <pipework> dudedudeman: You can do it! Just don't suck.
2015-04-10 23:56 <terrellt> That seems good to me then.
2015-04-10 23:56 <dudedudeman> haha. i'm working on it!
2015-04-10 23:56 <dudedudeman> i have a few freelance clients, and have been at 'code' for about a year and a half
