2015-04-04 01:32 <hoelzro> riceandbeans: I'm the same way
2015-04-04 01:32 <riceandbeans> I had to use perl a lot more for work a couple jobs back
2015-04-04 01:32 <riceandbeans> it just got...really heavily engrained in me
2015-04-04 01:33 <shevy> mozzarella why did you switch to ruby, or are you still using both?

2015-04-04 01:45 <mozzarella> I didn't like the forced indentation of python, the explicit self, the fact that sometimes you must call methods on objects and sometimes you must pass objects to functions (i.e. len("str") vs "str".len), the fact that there are two different versions of the language, etc.
2015-04-04 01:45 <shevy> yeah

2015-04-04 01:49 <mozzarella> I like ruby's blocks and "functional" functions like map, select, find, etc.
2015-04-04 01:50 <mozzarella> it's great to be able to chain them without having to nest function calls

2015-04-04 08:42 <Bacta> I've got a directory of Ruby files with each defining a class inside module X and inheriting from X::Base
2015-04-04 08:43 <Bacta> But when I call descendants I only get the classes from source files I'm included
2015-04-04 08:43 djbkd has quit [Remote host closed the connection]
2015-04-04 08:43 <Bacta> I'm a beginner to Ruby but not to programming. It smells like the code I've inherited wasn't designed very well in terms of structure.
2015-04-04 08:44 <Bacta> Any ideas on what's going wrong?
2015-04-04 08:45 <sevenseacat> you cant use classes defined in files you havent loaded

2015-04-04 08:46 <Bacta> Makes sense. What's the "Ruby Way" for initialising modules spanning multiple files?
2015-04-04 08:46 <sevenseacat> to require all of the modules that the class depends on, in the file itself

2015-04-04 11:12 <jgorak> Hi all.  Is there some shorthand for this structure?  I googled but can't find anything better:   y=if(defined? x); x; else; 1; end
2015-04-04 11:12 delianides has joined #ruby
2015-04-04 11:12 <toertore> do you actually need to use defined? ?
2015-04-04 11:12 chinmay_dd has quit [Quit: Leaving]
2015-04-04 11:12 <toertore> i guess so, since it's a local var
2015-04-04 11:13 bMalum has quit [Quit: bMalum]
2015-04-04 11:13 <toertore> the only "shorthand" is to use a ternary
2015-04-04 11:13 <jhass> being uncertain whether a local var is defined is a clear sign that something is going wrong
2015-04-04 11:13 <jhass> jgorak: why do you need that check?
2015-04-04 11:13 <jgorak> i'm using it in a template.  i want to have a default value if variable wasn't set when the template is ... templated
2015-04-04 11:13 <avril14th> val ||= 1 ?
2015-04-04 11:14 <toertore> jgorak: what do you mean by template?
2015-04-04 11:14 <toertore> gist some code?
2015-04-04 11:15 <jgorak> I'm using erb by just cat'ing two files and piping them into it.  One file sets variables. The other is the template.
2015-04-04 11:15 <toertore> gist?

2015-04-04 11:19 <jgorak> gist for what I'm doing is at https://gist.github.com/anonymous/0648122388927e200590 .  sometimes my vars file won't have variables defined
2015-04-04 11:21 <jgorak> i want my doc to have a default value if the vars file doesn't set it
2015-04-04 11:21 <toertore> do you need to distinguish between "being set" and "being non-nil"?

2015-04-04 11:23 <jgorak> As in- can I set it to empty to start and append/reassign as needed?
2015-04-04 11:23 <jgorak> My problem there is the naming is currently all caps, and it complains about changing constants
2015-04-04 11:24 <jgorak> Ideally I keep that, but I really don't have to.
2015-04-04 11:24 <toertore> gist real code pls?
2015-04-04 11:24 <toertore> i don't really like erb, it's too metaprogrammy
2015-04-04 11:24 <jgorak> Can't use the exact stuff.  It's on a work computer.  I'll build enough that it's useful for this convo

2015-04-04 11:39 <jgorak> https://gist.github.com/anonymous/264eb5f74413528cd331 is a little closer to what I mean.  I'm templating bash scripts that go on servers.  I'm trying to match the variable names in the ruby parts with the variable names in the bash parts, all caps.

2015-04-04 14:28 <FernandoBasso> I am taking a look at all the links the docs mention. I'd like some kind of tutorial/book that teaches by using programs, instead of "5.to_s converts 5 to a string"-like stuff. Is there such a thing?
2015-04-04 14:29 <FernandoBasso> I just saw the example "puts `ls`". I have no idea on how to make something useful with that.
2015-04-04 14:31 <FernandoBasso> (that is one reason I kind of like the head first books)
2015-04-04 14:31 <FernandoBasso> Perhaps a cookbook.

2015-04-04 14:34 <FernandoBasso> Although I admit I like the "thehardway" series. But I didn't know there was a ruby one. Thanks.
2015-04-04 14:34 <sevenseacat> why do they discourage it? out of curiosity

2015-04-04 14:36 <FernandoBasso> Too many factual problems and a presentation that gets you to do things wrongly before being shown how to do it correctly, and not even always then.

2015-04-04 14:37 <FernandoBasso> I appreciate those resources anyway.
2015-04-04 14:37 <tier> let's be honest, if you're just starting with a language you have no idea what's good and what isn't anyway
2015-04-04 14:37 <sevenseacat> i have to admit i like the head first series for concepts, but not for languages
2015-04-04 14:37 <sevenseacat> head first design patterns was probably my favorite
2015-04-04 14:38 <FernandoBasso> tier: yeah, but that is also a good reason one should read something reliable. I guess your argument actually can work both ways.

2015-04-04 14:47 <jonathan2> this is in a docker container based on progrium/busybox. my question is why the bundle install would fail while gem install would succeed, though.
2015-04-04 14:48 <sevenseacat> `gem unstall unf_ext -v 0.0.6` succeeds?
2015-04-04 14:48 <jonathan2> no, that fails

2015-04-04 14:49 <sevenseacat> the version of the gem you've included in your bundle, yeah
2015-04-04 14:49 <sevenseacat> the version you're installing with `gem install redis` probably doesnt
2015-04-04 14:50 <jonathan2> i'm not specifying a version explicitly in the gemspec file, so i'm not sure why the two methods would be trying different versions

2015-04-04 16:41 <FernandoBasso> And why did they name the method `instance_methods` if we call it from a class name, not from an object?
2015-04-04 16:42 <jhass> it returns the instance methods defined in the class object
2015-04-04 16:42 <jhass> the instance methods of a class object will become the methods of the classes instances

2015-04-04 16:55 <FernandoBasso> Just like to many forks of open source projects. That is just my opinion, though.
2015-04-04 16:55 <apeiros> I don't think so. or rather, I don't think it matters how many there are.
2015-04-04 16:55 <FernandoBasso> apeiros: I agree it probably doesn't matter.
2015-04-04 16:55 <apeiros> mostly because the idea that "if A can make 100x happen, and B can make 100x happen, why don't they work together and make 200x happen?" is simply not true.

2015-04-04 18:05 <shevy> deansc not really, you see that many more people enter programming simply because many more people will have access to a computer, new young ones come up, and many end up using any among the scripting language
2015-04-04 18:05 <Nilium> It might also just become another language.
2015-04-04 18:05 <jhass> deansc: what motivates that question?
2015-04-04 18:05 <shevy> oh noes jhass is asking metaquestions
2015-04-04 18:05 <jhass> apeiros: I think we have another FAQ entry here :P
2015-04-04 18:05 <Nilium> Do people ask this a lot?
2015-04-04 18:05 <shevy> cool, is there a FAQ page already?
2015-04-04 18:05 <jhass> too often

2015-04-04 18:06 <shevy> apeiros knows his stuff
2015-04-04 18:06 <deansc> i don't know, people criticizes it sometimes because it is slow.
2015-04-04 18:07 <apeiros> jhass: PR!
2015-04-04 18:07 <Nilium> So you mean the criticism everyone throws out about every language?
2015-04-04 18:07 <jhass> apeiros: I would, but you hid the general section
2015-04-04 18:07 <Nilium> Slow, hard to understand, too simple, too complex, etc.
2015-04-04 18:07 <shevy> the http://ruby-community.com/pages/user_rules refers to #ruby right and not #ruby-lang? I guess I could add a FAQ entry... "The enemy people on #ruby-lang" :)
2015-04-04 18:07 <jordsmi> Just because it's not perfect for some tasks doesn't mean it is overall bad

2015-04-04 18:07 <apeiros> jhass: do it anyway. general section will be back soon. or just remove the problematic Q&As from general
2015-04-04 18:07 <Nilium> They're pretty meaningless criticisms without some context for them.
2015-04-04 18:08 <deansc> I love this language I think it's fun to program with it.
2015-04-04 18:08 <yxhuvvd> deansc, people have *always* complained about slowness. The problem is a lot less now than it was, and further improvements are on the way.
2015-04-04 18:08 <shevy> deansc well, the speed comparisons to php python perl and ruby are really quite comparable; a lot of the slowness part has been said like 10 years ago, ruby got faster since then too
2015-04-04 18:08 <Nilium> Ruby 2.x is doing pretty well on the performance front.
2015-04-04 18:08 <jhass> okay, I'll write the "Will Ruby die?" FAQ entry, who's up for "Is Ruby slow?"
2015-04-04 18:08 <shevy> lol
2015-04-04 18:08 <shevy> jhass well show how this is done ok? I want to see how or where it appears and how this is done

2015-04-04 18:09 <jhass> hah, you have to put that into your own PR though :P
2015-04-04 18:09 <deansc> no no but compared to node for example
2015-04-04 18:09 <Nilium> I'm lazy. shevy, do the PR for me.
2015-04-04 18:09 <shevy> we can copy/paste the IRC content right into the faq
2015-04-04 18:09 <Nilium> Compared to node for what?
2015-04-04 18:09 <shevy> ok I have to add one entry to the faq
2015-04-04 18:09 <deansc> nevermind
2015-04-04 18:09 <shevy> what is PR?
2015-04-04 18:10 <Nilium> Pull request. On GitHub.

2015-04-04 19:22 <shevy> I'd love namespaced gems, it's annoying that inactive gems can fill up namespaces and nobody uses them
2015-04-04 19:22 <apeiros> namespace owners could set up rules
2015-04-04 19:23 jlast has quit [Ping timeout: 265 seconds]
2015-04-04 19:23 <apeiros> like "no updates for >1y -> removal from the namespace". gem can still exist, but no longer occupies a well known namespace.
2015-04-04 19:23 <havenwood> we don't seem to really quite follow the limited gem naming conventions we do have

2015-04-04 19:24 <havenwood> hmm
2015-04-04 19:25 <apeiros> we could have namespaces by quality. org.rubygems.gold -> follows code style guide, has >1 patch per month, is 100% doc covered, has 100% C0 code/test coverage

2015-04-04 20:42 <havenwood> Nilium: Especially not large ones.
2015-04-04 20:42 <Nilium> Just don't try to: search in files, search in a file, or open anything over 2mb
2015-04-04 20:42 <Nilium> Atom cannot actually open files over 2mb.
2015-04-04 20:42 <Nilium> At least it tells you this now.

2015-04-04 20:43 <Nilium> I've only seen, so far, two text editors that could open large files without croaking
2015-04-04 20:43 <Nilium> One was ConTEXT on Windows, the other is vim.
2015-04-04 20:43 <apeiros> bbedit can handle fairly large files too
2015-04-04 20:43 <Nilium> I'd guess emacs could do it too but I don't open it for fear of not being able to figure out how to close it.
2015-04-04 20:43 <havenwood> Nilium: TM2 is actually good with large files.
2015-04-04 20:43 <apeiros> could deal better with it, though
2015-04-04 20:43 <jhass> well, there's a difference between many lines or one very long line
2015-04-04 20:44 <Nilium> jhass: True. One very long line in vim is a problem.
2015-04-04 20:44 <havenwood> Nilium: LightTable, Atom and even Sublime choke.

2015-04-04 20:44 <FernandoBasso> I have had problems with vim when lines are long (>= 150 chars). Although it has been a long time since I opened a file like that.
2015-04-04 20:44 <Nilium> Lately Sublime's been choking on all sorts of stuff for me.
2015-04-04 20:44 <jhass> and same with sublime, it takes a while to load but it can handle quite large files, if it contains enough line breaks
2015-04-04 20:44 <jhass> you tried sublime 3?
2015-04-04 20:44 <Nilium> Easiest thing to do is just fold something and pipe it
2015-04-04 20:44 <Nilium> I'm using Sublime 3.
2015-04-04 20:45 <jhass> has been quite stable for me
2015-04-04 20:45 <Nilium> It's normally stable but has been garbage lately.
2015-04-04 20:45 <Nilium> On the upside, the plugin_host crash is gone.
2015-04-04 20:45 <Nilium> That was the one that made me switch to vim.

2015-04-04 20:46 <Nilium> Having to restart your text editor once every 30-50 minutes is annoying.

2015-04-04 20:50 <Nilium> Log files, SQL, etc.
2015-04-04 20:50 <Nilium> Also, as a credit to vim, it's the only editor I have right now that opens compressed text files.
2015-04-04 20:50 <FernandoBasso> My problems were with xml as well (long lines in xml files vs vim)

2015-04-04 20:58 <Nilium> Also, converting an svn repo with weird directory structure to git is nightmarish
2015-04-04 20:58 <Nilium> Especially since all of the tags in the one I'm moving point to subdirectories in the trunk.
2015-04-04 20:58 <Nilium> So git can't match different commits up.

2015-04-04 23:34 <Ellis> im learning about data structures and i’m reading about graphs, what is a practical example of a graph in ruby? is a hash a graph?
2015-04-04 23:35 <apeiros> this ftw: `class Fixnum; def inspect; to_s.reverse.gsub(/.{3}(?=.)/, '\0_').reverse; end; end`
2015-04-04 23:36 <apeiros> Ellis: no, a hash is not a graph. but you can use it to implement one.
2015-04-04 23:37 <Ellis> apeiros: can you help me wrap my head around graphs by giving me an example of one, maybe using ruby on rails
