2015-04-06 03:15 <woop> if you use the rails generators, the files are all created properly for you
2015-04-06 03:16 <iraszl_> thanks, yes, I have them, I have run the “controller” generator
2015-04-06 03:16 <iraszl_> i think I should use the welcome_controller.rb file to include my ruby code
2015-04-06 03:17 <iraszl_> it currently contains this:
2015-04-06 03:17 <iraszl_> class WelcomeController < ApplicationController
2015-04-06 03:17 <iraszl_>   def index
2015-04-06 03:17 <iraszl_>   end

2015-04-06 05:11 <TimeWaster> sup yall
2015-04-06 05:11 <TimeWaster> why would i be scared of a ban lmoa
2015-04-06 05:11 <TimeWaster> i have a life
2015-04-06 05:11 <TimeWaster> that includes not sitting on #ruby all day
2015-04-06 05:11 <TimeWaster> why would i give a fuck
2015-04-06 05:12 <TimeWaster> thats not even a warning
2015-04-06 05:12 <TimeWaster> thats like saying i'm not allowed into the women's washroom
2015-04-06 05:12 <TimeWaster> its like ok?
2015-04-06 05:12 <krainboltgreene> If Ruby became whitespace sensitive tomorrow, like completely whitespace sensitive, do you think your libraries would be super affected?
2015-04-06 05:12 <TimeWaster> i personally wouldnt care
2015-04-06 05:12 <TimeWaster> cause i have a life
2015-04-06 05:14 <havenwood> TimeWaster: Do you read or write Ruby?
2015-04-06 05:14 <TimeWaster> yeah i do actually
2015-04-06 05:14 <krainboltgreene> I wouldn't bother.

2015-04-06 05:16 <TimeWaster> krainboltgreene:stop talking shit
2015-04-06 05:16 <havenwood> krainboltgreene: I'm probably overlooking the pain points.
2015-04-06 05:16 <krainboltgreene> That's what I was thinking. I've started to self-enforce strict oneline hashes, and I feel like it's improved my ability to see "too complex" code.
2015-04-06 05:16 <havenwood> TimeWaster: Stop picking fights. If you'd like to discuss, join us.
2015-04-06 05:18 <havenwood> krainboltgreene: Do you like the aesthetics of whitespace delimited blocks?
2015-04-06 05:18 <krainboltgreene> Yeah, I rarely do inline blocks at least.

2015-04-06 05:24 <Eiam_> Can anyone think of some kind of "blob storage" API thats already been written that I could deploy locally vs writing it myself? something like "here is some data of type "abc", please store it" and discovery "what data of type "abc" do you have?" and GET <uuid> to retrieve said files? I don't think it would be particularly hard to write, nor do I need any kind of huge scaling, nor can I use something like azure.  I figured a project might already exist but
2015-04-06 05:24 <Eiam_>  all my googling keeps hitting azure, AWS type stuff.

2015-04-06 07:21 <riceandbeans> havenwood: everything you said sounded like it wasn't english
2015-04-06 07:22 <riceandbeans> in that context, whit is a closure, what does strict mean, what is arity, and what does the current context mean?
2015-04-06 07:23 <havenwood> riceandbeans: arity is like how many args it's passed. so if it expects one argument and you pass it two, strict arity will raise an ArgumentError.

2015-04-06 07:25 <havenwood> riceandbeans: returning in the current context means that if you return from a lambda inside a method it'll proceed with the rest of the method

2015-04-06 07:30 <havenwood> riceandbeans: `lambda { |h| h }` or the stabby lambda form `->(h) { h }` are lambdas

2015-04-06 09:56 <wasamasa> no, you'd probably need to tokenize it first, then check whether the tokens are composed correctly
2015-04-06 09:56 <wasamasa> in other words, writing a parser for domains
2015-04-06 09:56 <apeiros> though, thinking about it, I think IDNs are best handled by checking whether there's [\x80-\xff] in the url, apply punycode transformation, then check normally.

2015-04-06 10:15 <apeiros> also your regex is wrong
2015-04-06 10:15 <apeiros> header delimiter is not \n, it's \r\n
2015-04-06 10:15 <apeiros> if you have to deal with broken clients/servers, use \r?\n

2015-04-06 10:16 <apeiros> note that your regex will actually turn \r\n into \n
2015-04-06 10:16 <unshadow> IIS uses \n, apache + nginx does \r\n
2015-04-06 10:17 <apeiros> how ridiculous. the one server which stems from the \r\n touting OS uses \n

2015-04-06 10:18 <unshadow>     return data.split("\r\n\r\n") unless data.split("\r\n\r\n")[1].nil?
2015-04-06 10:18 <unshadow>     return data.split("\n\n") unless data.split("\n\n")[1].nil?

2015-04-06 10:31 <jhass> are you sure the timeout is in sinatra and not in your appserver?
2015-04-06 10:31 <jhass> or even your frontend webserver?

2015-04-06 10:36 <jhass> which by applications not showing trailing . could be represented as empty space I guess
2015-04-06 10:37 <apeiros> but above rule says domain is either subdomain or a space… seems to me that says a single space is a valid domain…

2015-04-06 10:37 <jhass> yeah, but as said that definition doesn't include the trailing ., so I think that's what they accommodate for
2015-04-06 10:38 <apeiros> shouldn't it then have been "" instead of " "?

2015-04-06 18:17 <nyuszika7h> why is a space added before the timezone offset in logger.datetime_format?
2015-04-06 18:17 <nyuszika7h> code: logger.datetime_format = '%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S%z'
2015-04-06 18:17 <shevy> year month date
2015-04-06 18:17 <nyuszika7h> expected result is 2015-04-06 20:16:22+0200, actual result is 2015-04-06 20:16:22 +0200

2015-04-06 18:19 <nyuszika7h> would you bother reading?
2015-04-06 18:20 <nyuszika7h> that's all the code you need

2015-04-06 18:20 <nyuszika7h> I'm not stupid
2015-04-06 18:20 <shevy> look above
2015-04-06 18:20 <eam> nyuszika7h: no one's suggesting you're stupid. There's probably a difference with what you're doing and what we're doing
2015-04-06 18:21 <eam> that difference needs to be discovered to solve this question
2015-04-06 18:21 <nyuszika7h> eam: yes, I'm using logger.datetime_format
2015-04-06 18:21 <shevy> did you test it in irb by the way? perhaps the logger in use modifies something
2015-04-06 18:21 <nyuszika7h> I doubt it, but I'll post the code just in case
2015-04-06 18:21 <shevy> can you reproduce the behaviour in irb

2015-04-06 21:39 <misterghost> i need help with a couple methods that i have in my app
2015-04-06 21:39 <misterghost> they are working perfect, but only locally
2015-04-06 21:39 <misterghost> not on heroku
2015-04-06 21:40 <bradland> misterghost: the best thing to do is to copy/paste the methods in to a gist on gist.github.com, then post the link here
2015-04-06 21:40 <bradland> that way we can see the code
2015-04-06 21:40 <misterghost> so far ive incestigated and its because the GROUP BY is bad...so i need to rephrase those methods so they dont crash with herokus pg database

2015-04-06 21:42 <bradland> i'd try that
2015-04-06 21:43 <jhass> (technically correct, whether it produces the result you want is another question)
2015-04-06 21:43 <centrx> misterghost, When using a GROUP BY, every item in the SELECT list should either be an aggregate method, a constant, or be a column in the GROUP BY clause
2015-04-06 21:43 <bradland> interesting that it works locally
2015-04-06 21:43 <bradland> are you running pg?
2015-04-06 21:43 <jhass> prolly sqlite or something locally
2015-04-06 21:43 <misterghost> nope, sqlite3
