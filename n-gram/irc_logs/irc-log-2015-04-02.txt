2015-04-02 00:02 <ramfjord> I'm trying to do something similar with sql.erb files, but I don't want the whole view structure that comes with ActionView
2015-04-02 00:02 <Radar> ramfjord: #rubyonrails
2015-04-02 00:03 <ramfjord> hmmm, would have thought this would be more of an ERB question

2015-04-02 00:13 <ramfjord> I'll probably just assign the varaibles in the template before rendering the partial if I can't figure out how to pass locals in within the next 20 mins

2015-04-02 00:15 <pipework> A sad thing you might be able to do is munge those variables so that each scope they exist in have uniquely munged variables that they end up calling so you can make a single call to ERB with the whole string later.

2015-04-02 00:19 <pipework> Alright, so, whenever your current binding calls the thing that you call to render a partial, have that method that you call get a new object. Then within that new object that was passed locals, you can on initialize either define methods or be lazy and use method_missing to both call those locals as whale as probably define a method.
2015-04-02 00:21 <pipework> Like render would call, SQLPartial.new and pass it whatever is appropriate, including self so that you can let a template call the parent's 'locals'
2015-04-02 00:21 <pipework> If you want.
2015-04-02 00:22 <ramfjord> ahh, pass in self as the parent and method_missing? delegate anything that's not in the new object's binding to self

2015-04-02 00:23 <pipework> Or, if you're awesome, you won't allow partials to call parents at all and you'll require that anything it needs be passed in.
2015-04-02 00:23 <pipework> That would make it even easier.

2015-04-02 03:43 <Radar> what sevenseacat said
2015-04-02 03:43 <Radar> Why are you manipulating strings in your css anyway?
2015-04-02 03:43 <CorySimmons> Radar: Because I'm a super cool dude trying to make a super cool grid system
2015-04-02 03:44 <CorySimmons> Basically I'm trying to make a Sass mixin where I can grab the numerator and denominator of a fraction and perform griddy stuff on them
2015-04-02 03:44 <sevenseacat> i miss the days where css was simple
2015-04-02 03:44 <CorySimmons> I've got this in my config.rb http://pastie.org/10068898

2015-04-02 03:45 <CorySimmons> But $bar returns false
2015-04-02 03:45 <pipework> sevenseacat: You mean pre 2.0?
2015-04-02 03:45 <sevenseacat> pipework: i'll even include 2.0.
2015-04-02 03:45 <CorySimmons> sevenseacat: I take it you're a dev?
2015-04-02 03:46 <sevenseacat> given we're in a dev channel, that's a fair assumption.
2015-04-02 03:46 <CorySimmons> If you don't see value in things like Bootstrap and such I don't know what to tell you
2015-04-02 03:46 <pipework> sevenseacat: Ooh ballsy
2015-04-02 03:46 <sevenseacat> thats an awesome interpretation of what i said
2015-04-02 03:46 <pipework> CorySimmons: Whale, I dislike bootstrap a lot.
2015-04-02 03:47 <pipework> But I prefer mixins and a library that doesn't perversely use things that aren't meant for the things they appropriate them for.

2015-04-02 03:47 <CorySimmons> Yeah I'm not a fan of Bootstrap either, but I see it's value
2015-04-02 03:48 <CorySimmons> Not sure what sevenseacat meant by bastardizing simple things
2015-04-02 03:48 <CorySimmons> referring to my grid system specifically i guess?
2015-04-02 03:48 <sevenseacat> yep.

2015-04-02 03:49 <Radar> I'd join in but I have more important things to do like be nice to people.
2015-04-02 03:49 <CorySimmons> just don't like people shitting on what i'm interested in because they don't understand it
2015-04-02 03:49 <pipework> CorySimmons: It does.
2015-04-02 03:49 <pipework> She understands it.
2015-04-02 03:49 <sevenseacat> where on earth did i 'shit on anything'?
2015-04-02 03:49 <pipework> What made you think that she didn't understand it?
2015-04-02 03:50 <CorySimmons> sevenseacat: Sorry, misinterpretted "bastardizing" as a bad thing
2015-04-02 03:50 <pipework> Is it normal for you to react so caustically to things that upset you?
2015-04-02 03:50 <sevenseacat> pipework: pot, kettle, black :P
2015-04-02 03:50 <CorySimmons> Ugh, sorry =[

2015-04-02 08:43 <SebastianThorn> hi guys, can i differ in my sinatra code how my app is run? i would like to use "puts" when shotgun, and logger when apache is run
2015-04-02 08:43 stef204 has joined #ruby
2015-04-02 08:43 <SebastianThorn> or is there an easier way of doing this?
2015-04-02 08:43 chinmay_dd has quit [Ping timeout: 245 seconds]
2015-04-02 08:43 <adaedra> Use environments
2015-04-02 08:44 <adaedra> Use a single logger with different parameters (minimal level, output) under different environments (development, production)
2015-04-02 08:44 camilasan has quit [Ping timeout: 255 seconds]
2015-04-02 08:44 <adaedra> And let apache use your app in production mode

2015-04-02 08:46 zarubin_ has quit [Ping timeout: 264 seconds]
2015-04-02 08:46 <adaedra> there’s multiple ways of setting this
2015-04-02 08:47 camilasan has joined #ruby
2015-04-02 08:47 <adaedra> I think the RACK_ENV environment variable is the most common
2015-04-02 08:48 <SebastianThorn> ok, i found some pieces on google regarding this now, thank you for pointing me in the right direction :)

2015-04-02 10:34 <DeathCode> oh wrong channel
2015-04-02 10:34 <DeathCode> this was meant for ##java
2015-04-02 10:34 <adaedra> that makes sense
2015-04-02 10:34 sdothum has joined #ruby
2015-04-02 10:35 <workmad3> DeathCode: in answer to your question though, 'yes, lots'
2015-04-02 10:35 <DeathCode> workmad3:what about web databases?
2015-04-02 10:35 <workmad3> DeathCode: what about them?
2015-04-02 10:35 <DeathCode> can java be used for them?
2015-04-02 10:35 <workmad3> DeathCode: as in "What you do mean by 'web databases'?"

2015-04-02 10:36 <adaedra> Java is a generic language, it can be used for many things
2015-04-02 10:36 <DeathCode> can java develop web databases?
2015-04-02 10:36 <DeathCode> that was my question
2015-04-02 10:36 <adaedra> and his was « what do you mean by 'web databases'? »
2015-04-02 10:36 Pupeno has quit [Remote host closed the connection]
2015-04-02 10:36 <workmad3> DeathCode: I have no clue what the fuck a 'web database' is though... it's not actually a term that makes sense
2015-04-02 10:37 <DeathCode> like a database stored on the web
2015-04-02 10:37 <DeathCode> like profile information
2015-04-02 10:37 <DeathCode> data
2015-04-02 10:37 <DeathCode> for each profile
2015-04-02 10:37 <workmad3> DeathCode: ok... and now you're still spouting nonsense... 'database stored on the web'???
2015-04-02 10:37 <DeathCode> i dunno how to explain
2015-04-02 10:37 <DeathCode> but can java be used for that
2015-04-02 10:38 <workmad3> DeathCode: considering I have no clue what you're even asking, I don't know how you expect an answer...
2015-04-02 10:38 <adaedra> if we cannot understand what you mean, we can’t give you an answer
2015-04-02 10:38 <DeathCode> ok hold on
2015-04-02 10:38 <DeathCode> let me try
2015-04-02 10:38 <adaedra> begin*
2015-04-02 10:38 <workmad3> DeathCode: do you mean 'A web app that stores data in a database'?
2015-04-02 10:38 iasoon has joined #ruby
2015-04-02 10:39 <DeathCode> ok so lets say i have this website where i have people's information, banking info, pictures, text, aboue me section, etc. as profiles on there where people can log in and stuff and access that etc.
2015-04-02 10:39 <DeathCode> kinda like facebook or tinder or what have you
2015-04-02 10:39 <workmad3> DeathCode: ok... you just described a fairly typical web app, yes
2015-04-02 10:39 <DeathCode> i want to use java to handle those "databases"
2015-04-02 10:39 <workmad3> DeathCode: or at least, part of one
2015-04-02 10:39 <DeathCode> can that be done?
2015-04-02 10:39 <workmad3> DeathCode: that's not a 'database'... that's a web app
2015-04-02 10:39 <DeathCode> ok its kind of like a database though
2015-04-02 10:39 <DeathCode> lol
2015-04-02 10:39 <workmad3> DeathCode: it most likely *uses* a database
2015-04-02 10:39 <DeathCode> but ye thats what i mean
2015-04-02 10:39 <adaedra> You’re still not really clear
2015-04-02 10:39 <DeathCode> YES YES
2015-04-02 10:40 devoldmx has joined #ruby
2015-04-02 10:40 <workmad3> DeathCode: but it has application logic that handles the stuff like 'logging in' and 'access control' in ways beyond what a generic database server provides
2015-04-02 10:40 <DeathCode> so thats good?
2015-04-02 10:41 <workmad3> DeathCode: so basically your question is twofold - "Can java do webapps?" which was already answered, and "Can java access databases?" to which the answer should be pretty damn obvious :P
2015-04-02 10:41 <adaedra> yes, a web application, even database-backed, can be developped in Java, if it’s what you’re asking
2015-04-02 10:41 <DeathCode> awesome :D
2015-04-02 10:42 <DeathCode> thanks guys

2015-04-02 11:57 <certainty> i don't use ruby for anything performance critical so speed is not a reason. having a single binary is nice for deployment and having a statically linked binary even more so.

2015-04-02 12:02 <certainty> how do you approach the problems that arise with the usage of let in rspec? I mean when you have let-bound a value and want to make sure it exists before something else. Before-hooks don't work nice here. Also let! doesn't work so nice in situations whith nested contexts where the order of the creation of values matters, and a let! at the top is simply too early.
2015-04-02 12:02 Takle has joined #ruby
2015-04-02 12:02 <certainty> my current solution is a small helper: def force(*); end   which i use to deliberately force those values

2015-04-02 12:20 <g105b> Hi I'm meant to be fixing some JavaScript on a project made in Ruby... I don't know anything about Ruby, so I was wondering if someone could tell me what to do to get the project running locally? I have a Gemfile, a Gemfile.lock, then all the source, and I don't know how to get started.

2015-04-02 12:23 <jhass> okay, if it's still 2.1 you can get away with changing that line to the version you have or removing it
2015-04-02 12:24 <jhass> how did  you install ruby? package manager?

2015-04-02 12:26 <adaedra> you may need root permissions to install bundler globally
2015-04-02 12:26 <jhass> g105b: it will most likely tell you a path to add to your $PATH though
2015-04-02 12:26 <g105b> I see.
2015-04-02 12:27 <adaedra> Are you supposed to commit the Gemfile.lock file?
2015-04-02 12:27 <jhass> yes
2015-04-02 12:27 <arup_r> jhass: nasty Rails.application.routes.routes.map{ |r| r.verb.source[/[a-z]+/i] }
2015-04-02 12:27 <jhass> if you don't you loose the main point of using bundler in fact
2015-04-02 12:28 <g105b> jhass: ah it looks like I need to have that version of ruby installed. I changed it in the Gemfile to match mine, but I get this error: mkmf.rb can't find header files for ruby at /usr/lib/ruby/include/ruby.h
2015-04-02 12:28 <adaedra> I always leave it ignored, as it is generated by bundle

2015-04-02 15:04 <clumps> hi -- how do I add a member variable at run time?  I do class << MyClass, add attr_accessor :foo, but also add "to_s", in which I add @foo, but when the code runs, it claims @foo is not defined.  What else do I need to do to make this work?
2015-04-02 15:04 <jhass> clumps: strong indication that you're doing something wrong. But just reopen the class
2015-04-02 15:05 <jhass> class << MyClass reopens the class' singleton class
2015-04-02 15:05 <jhass> (it's the same as class << self inside class MyClass)
2015-04-02 15:06 <clumps> jhass:  so when I add attr_accessor :foo to that opened class will using "@foo" just not work?
2015-04-02 15:06 <jhass> sorry?

2015-04-02 15:09 <clumps> I must have a poor understanding of how this works.  Don't you want to tweak the singleton that produces all new Foos?

2015-04-02 20:05 <replicant> that was my firs tthought too :/
2015-04-02 20:05 <shadoi1> I'm assuming :id and :name are parameters to some URL?
2015-04-02 20:05 <shadoi1> or just variables in the template?

2015-04-02 20:07 <shadoi1> replicant: we'd need to know a bit more about what :id or :name could be, those are just symbols.  Where you're looking they could refer to hash keys, query parameters, etc. etc.

2015-04-02 23:38 <nettoweb> Im lost with this file... hehe. I thught I could edit well. but is not so easy
2015-04-02 23:38 <willharrison> https://gist.github.com/willharrison/2ea0d002d7fb45ded67a can anyone see what might be going wrong here?  it's at line 27 on the KaraInt class
2015-04-02 23:38 <jhass> bonhoeffer: lambda returns an object, it doesn't define a method

2015-04-02 23:39 <bonhoeffer> hmm . . . but that object is an anonymous function, right?
2015-04-02 23:39 <bonhoeffer> which, well, is a lot like a method
2015-04-02 23:40 <jhass> in Ruby it's actually closer to a block than to a method

2015-04-02 23:45 <bonhoeffer> so for f=Math.sin(x), if I want to pass this to a method which will call f(0), what is the best way? a method, block, proc, lambda?

2015-04-02 23:46 <jhass> willharrison: ah nvm about fill, was misinterpreting something
2015-04-02 23:47 <bonhoeffer> i guess i should just use .call(0)
2015-04-02 23:47 <bonhoeffer> and not worry about it

2015-04-02 23:47 <jhass> bonhoeffer: only the last three are closures, methods aren't

2015-04-02 23:48 <jhass> bonhoeffer: did you check out yield yet?
2015-04-02 23:48 <bonhoeffer> yeah — i could yield a proc
