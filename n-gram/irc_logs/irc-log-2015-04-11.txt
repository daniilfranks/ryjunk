2015-04-11 00:50 <SirFunk> Generally inheritance and/or composition feel icky to me
2015-04-11 00:50 <SirFunk> then you end up with methods in the child class calling methods that you have no idea where they come from until you start digging into the includes/parent classes
2015-04-11 00:50 <SirFunk> which are themselves often a few levels deep
2015-04-11 00:51 <SirFunk> I'd rather just use some other class that encapsulates the logic and is named for what it does

2015-04-11 01:56 <Coraline> Fair
2015-04-11 01:57 <FernandoBasso> But I intend to go through Poignant in the future.
2015-04-11 01:57 <kubunto> FernandoBasso: again what was in the tutorial
2015-04-11 01:57 zubov has joined #ruby
2015-04-11 01:57 <FernandoBasso> kubunto: Basic stuff.
2015-04-11 01:58 <kubunto> math, string, set stuff, flow control?
2015-04-11 01:58 <FernandoBasso> I especially liked  the blocks vs procs vs lambdas section (which I'll have to review and practice again, to be fair)
2015-04-11 01:58 <FernandoBasso> kubunto: Yep.
2015-04-11 01:58 <FernandoBasso> I'm getting started at the classes and objects part right now.
2015-04-11 01:58 <FernandoBasso> I believe I'll have finished this course till Monday.

2015-04-11 02:01 <kubunto> FernandoBasso: i took up a project and choose to write in ruby
2015-04-11 02:01 icebourg has joined #ruby
2015-04-11 02:01 <kubunto> decided*
2015-04-11 02:01 <FernandoBasso> I'll try to make an ftp client for vim. I'll probably try Ruby for that.
2015-04-11 02:01 <Coraline> I started with Rails in 2007, then realized I needed to know Ruby, so I started in on the fundamentals of the language.

2015-04-11 02:01 <FernandoBasso> But how? Reading what?
2015-04-11 02:01 <Coraline> Mainly by trying things out and reading the docs
2015-04-11 02:01 <kubunto> i have been in school since 2010 learning the basics of programming
2015-04-11 02:02 <Coraline> I learn best by doing a project, personally

2015-04-11 02:02 <FernandoBasso> I finished uni last year. I'm from brazil and unis suck around here... So, I can't say I learned much there.
2015-04-11 02:03 <FernandoBasso> Coraline: I think I am like that, but when I engage in trying some real project, I feel disheartened and it always seems I have to learn the languages more first before really trying real projects. I guess I'll have to change that.

2015-04-11 02:03 <kubunto> Coraline: does Ruby have a lot to offer for web data analysis
2015-04-11 02:04 <Coraline> kubunto: depends on your goals? It's pretty powerful at munging and good for data structures, so e.g. processing logs would be a good use case.
2015-04-11 02:04 <Coraline> FernandoBasso: start small?

2015-04-11 02:07 <FernandoBasso> It seems ruby is my best bet for that (with nokogiri).

2015-04-11 03:38 <Nuck> classes are difficult?
2015-04-11 03:38 <kubunto> for me it is
2015-04-11 03:38 <Nuck> I hope you mean learning-classes and not object-classes
2015-04-11 03:38 <kubunto> i mean object classes in rb
2015-04-11 03:38 <Nuck> What's the problem?  Understanding how they work in Ruby or understanding classes as a concept? o_o
2015-04-11 03:38 <kubunto> Ruby
2015-04-11 03:39 <kubunto> i can do objects in java in my dreams
2015-04-11 03:39 <kubunto> or C#
2015-04-11 03:39 <Nuck> Oh.  That would explain why you have trouble in Ruby
2015-04-11 03:39 <diegoviola> isn't classes just a way to group methods to a specific context?
2015-04-11 03:39 <kubunto> diegoviola: yes
2015-04-11 03:39 <Nuck> C# and Java hail from the C++ line of OOP while Ruby hails from the Smalltalk camp
2015-04-11 03:39 <kubunto> Nuck: i can even do it in python
2015-04-11 03:39 <diegoviola> what's so difficult to understand about that?

2015-04-11 03:39 <Nuck> I think Python hails from the C++ camp too, but I don't use Python enough to say for sure
2015-04-11 03:40 <kubunto> diegoviola: ok, full disclosure i am a 5th year software engineering student
2015-04-11 03:40 <kubunto> i understand a lot about comp sci
2015-04-11 03:40 <kubunto> any way i think i am going to shelf this and attack it in a few days
2015-04-11 03:41 <kubunto> i am clearly frustrated beyond help
2015-04-11 03:41 <Nuck> Ruby classes are simple enough in premise as long as you don't try to dig too deep into eigenclasses and such
2015-04-11 03:41 <diegoviola> so think of a class as a context?
2015-04-11 03:41 <kubunto> Nuck: i am having initialization issues
2015-04-11 03:41 <Nuck> Once you accept that every class is an instance of the Class class, pretty much everything falls into place
2015-04-11 03:41 <Nuck> initialization issues? o_o
2015-04-11 03:42 <Nuck> But... it's just def initialize?
2015-04-11 03:42 <kubunto> not def new?
2015-04-11 03:42 <Nuck> Nope
2015-04-11 03:42 <Nuck> If you override the 'new' method, you'll remove the Ruby runtime's own allocation stuff
2015-04-11 03:43 <Nuck> So it's 'initialize' inside the class and 'new' outside (because new calls the initialize method itself)
2015-04-11 03:44 <kubunto> pardon my language but FOR FUCKS SAKE
2015-04-11 03:44 <kubunto> tis reaction of a senior programming student when it finally works

2015-04-11 04:05 <lemur> private is not class exclusive.
2015-04-11 04:05 <jud> anyone done a hack day at their company?
2015-04-11 04:05 <c-c> imo, one's "app" should declare one single global
2015-04-11 04:05 <Nuck> But aren't the private methods accessible in the Class?
2015-04-11 04:05 <c-c> no matter if js or ruby
2015-04-11 04:06 <Nuck> the class that mixes in the thing?
2015-04-11 04:06 <c-c> one, max
2015-04-11 04:06 <Nuck> c-c: One global is one too many
2015-04-11 04:06 <c-c> one global is fine

2015-04-11 04:06 <c-c> well, one global will not cause any measurable negative effect
2015-04-11 04:07 <Nuck> c-c: Technically JavaScript only has one global
2015-04-11 04:07 <Nuck> It's called "window"
2015-04-11 04:07 <c-c> no
2015-04-11 04:07 <Nuck> We see how well that worked for them
2015-04-11 04:07 <Nuck> :P
2015-04-11 04:07 <lemur> c-c: then you're designing it poorly, and that's all I'm saying on the matter.
2015-04-11 04:07 <Nuck> People have this horrible tendency to tack all kinds of riders onto the global, just to cram it through
2015-04-11 04:07 <lemur> Now then, hackathons
2015-04-11 04:07 <c-c> technically, thats off topic here, but last I used node, it didn't have "window"
2015-04-11 04:08 <Nuck> Yeah node has "global" instead
2015-04-11 04:08 <lemur> What we ended up going with was giving engineers 2-3 days off normal work (unless they were critical ops)
2015-04-11 04:08 <Nuck> And I think they don't let it automatically hit the global when you forget var
2015-04-11 04:09 <lemur> and basically said free reign as long as it relates to the company in some way. Gave out cash prizes at the end for best projects out there.
2015-04-11 04:09 <Nuck> But yeah, encapsulation.  How could I hide methods inside a mixin'd module, from the class it's mixed into?
2015-04-11 04:09 <lemur> Though really it depends on what you're wanting to know.

2015-04-11 04:09 <Nuck> The level of encapsulation needs to ensure at least that the class's subclasses cannot access those methods since this is a subclass-based DSL
2015-04-11 04:09 <lemur> Honestly not sure on that one, I'd be inclined to say it doesn't matter too much though.

2015-04-11 04:11 <jud> basically im trying to make it fun for engineers and impress business when it's all over
2015-04-11 04:11 <c-c> I'd try to think of it as organizing things, instead of "hiding" or "no access"
2015-04-11 04:11 <lemur> Making it worth their while without having to spend extra work time is the best way.

2015-04-11 04:20 <c-c> saying "function scope" means your scope is closed inside a function, which you argued for at least 3 times, Nuck
2015-04-11 04:20 <Nuck> It's *both* lexical and functional
2015-04-11 04:20 <Nuck> c-c: Yes and that's how it is :u
2015-04-11 04:21 <Nuck> it's lexically scoped within that function, inacessible outside it
2015-04-11 04:21 <Nuck> lol
2015-04-11 04:21 <Nuck> This is ridiculous
2015-04-11 04:21 <c-c> I have no idea what "functional scope" is, and I've had it with you guys making incorrect statements about javascript scope on #ruby

2015-04-11 05:38 <weaksauce> separated by underscores and lowercase.
2015-04-11 05:38 <dudedudeman> let me drop my tables in my db and do new migrations with all of this. i want to beat it in to my head to make sure i'm doing this right from the ground up

2015-04-11 05:43 <dudedudeman> rake test passes and all things look like they did before i started dicking around with this this afternoon
2015-04-11 05:44 <dudedudeman> things to take away from this: 1) be more strategic in my class naming 2) can call .superclass on stuff object means it's been called before 3) classes withing classes are weird and they smell funny
2015-04-11 05:44 oo_ has joined #ruby
2015-04-11 05:44 <weaksauce> a tip is to make the test fail to make sure it's actually running then make it pass

2015-04-11 05:44 <dudedudeman> sorry, submitted twice :(
2015-04-11 05:44 <dudedudeman> break the code, fix the code
2015-04-11 05:45 <dudedudeman> i'm still getting used to testing and even figuring out what to test
2015-04-11 05:45 <weaksauce> you can have a test that's the same name as another test and it will overwrite the first test

2015-04-11 05:45 <weaksauce> so you want to make sure you are not testing nothing :(

2015-04-11 05:48 <dudedudeman> i now have my two classes and they have a has_many relationshipo
2015-04-11 05:48 <dudedudeman> DCMonitor has_many Calibrations
2015-04-11 05:48 <dudedudeman> and Calibration belongs to DCMonitor
2015-04-11 05:49 <dudedudeman> Would it be DCMonitor.Calibration.new(foo stuff) to create a new row in my tables?

2015-04-11 05:50 <dudedudeman> i'm currently looking through the API but i figured i would just shove that out there
2015-04-11 05:51 <weaksauce> yeah that will make one but you need to save it
2015-04-11 05:52 <dudedudeman> .save
2015-04-11 05:52 <weaksauce> well you would create a DCMonitor first then call calibration.new on that
2015-04-11 05:52 <weaksauce> to attach it to that object
2015-04-11 05:52 <shevy> I just realized
2015-04-11 05:52 <dudedudeman> foo = DCMonitor.new

2015-04-11 05:53 <dudedudeman> ok. i'm just irb'ing
2015-04-11 05:53 <weaksauce> create is another way it builds and saves

2015-04-11 11:06 <phale> Ah
2015-04-11 11:06 <apeiros> krainboltgreene: your beloved #node.js doesn't seem to do an awful much against trolls…

2015-04-11 11:07 <krainboltgreene> I'm not going to discuss anything if you start off with passive aggressive wording.
2015-04-11 11:07 <apeiros> at least when I compare the average response time there and here, #ruby wins hands-down
2015-04-11 11:07 <apeiros> *shrug*
2015-04-11 11:07 <phale> Is Ruby still the slowest language?
2015-04-11 11:07 <krainboltgreene> That's what I thought.
2015-04-11 11:07 <phale> I'm scared of using it now.
2015-04-11 11:07 <apeiros> phale: no, still the second slowest
2015-04-11 11:07 <phale> Oh.
2015-04-11 11:07 <phale> What's the first slowest then?
2015-04-11 11:07 <apeiros> and that's usually more than fast enough

2015-04-11 11:08 <krainboltgreene> When it comes to community toxicity I take things pretty seriously.
2015-04-11 11:08 <apeiros> phale: and if it isn't fast enough, you can write native extensions.

2015-04-11 11:08 <apeiros> krainboltgreene: so what do you do about the situation in #node.js? in here, you ranted even with a response time of <3min…
2015-04-11 11:09 <apeiros> I don't see you rant over there.
2015-04-11 11:09 <krainboltgreene> I'm not going to discuss this if you're going to (again) use passive aggressive wording.
2015-04-11 11:09 <apeiros> we both know that that's not the reason.
2015-04-11 11:09 <phale> I want to create a file parser but the format I'm attempting to parse has no documentation whatsoever.
2015-04-11 11:09 <krainboltgreene> I asked you twice, I'll mute you if you continue.

Extra problem: the files are in vietnamese and the text in them needs to be downcased first (I have a mapping prepared)

2015-04-11 13:50 <jhass> kq_away_: mh, without experience on my own, that seems close to but below the border of using a dedicated fulltext search engine, depends on the amount of growth (if any) you expect I guess
2015-04-11 13:50 <undeadaedra> it will not match C performance, but may be efficient enough to handle things
2015-04-11 13:50 <phale> okay

2015-04-11 15:48 <mbff> Hello! I just discovered Ruby does not support method overloading. What then is the standard alternative then? Different method names like method1 and method1WithExtraThing?
2015-04-11 15:48 <mbff> or arg detection inside of a single method?
2015-04-11 15:49 <phale> mbff: define methods with the same name
2015-04-11 15:49 <mbff> I thought ruby only used the last one that was defined....
2015-04-11 15:50 <phale> it does i think
2015-04-11 15:50 <phale> ask jhass
2015-04-11 15:50 <mbff> right so if i have two methods..... method(thisVarShouldBeAStr) and method(thisVarShouldBeAnArray) .... ruby will only use the second one i define
2015-04-11 15:51 <phale> yes
2015-04-11 15:51 <mbff> jhass, any ideas? I am looking for the agreed on community standard
2015-04-11 15:51 <phale> I don't know why you want to overload a method with a different name
2015-04-11 15:51 mostlybadfly has joined #ruby
2015-04-11 15:52 <mbff> the names are the same, didn't you see my example above
2015-04-11 15:52 <mbff> both called "method"
2015-04-11 15:52 <phale> yes
2015-04-11 15:52 <phale> then it should work
2015-04-11 15:52 <mbff> it doesn
2015-04-11 15:52 <jhass> mbff: both is done equally, depending on usecase/context

2015-04-11 15:53 <phale> something like that
2015-04-11 15:54 <phale> not sure how to define methods on the interpreter here atm
2015-04-11 15:55 <phale> mbff: http://codepad.org/tm8AK5QC
2015-04-11 15:55 <Coraline> I believe it works if the method args are different
2015-04-11 15:55 <jhass> mbff: as a rule of thumb, if the overload would just transform the parameter and call another overload, you would usually perform input detection, if the behavior is significantly different, that's a good indicator (and that's not only true for Ruby) those are two different methods anyway
2015-04-11 15:55 <mbff> take a look at the top answer.... http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9373104/why-doesnt-ruby-support-method-overloading
2015-04-11 15:55 <jhass> Coraline: no, it doesn't ;)
2015-04-11 15:56 <Coraline> Hmm
2015-04-11 15:56 <Coraline> Was that ever the case, or am I mixing it up with another language/

2015-04-11 15:57 <eam> a better way to phrase that is instead of the language dictating rules for method dispatch, you have access to it dynamically

2015-04-11 15:59 <mbff> yes exactly...
2015-04-11 16:00 <elaptics> mbff: then just coerce the arg first thing to an array with Array(arg)
2015-04-11 16:00 <elaptics> then it'll always be an array
2015-04-11 16:00 <elaptics> an array will still be an array after that

2015-04-11 16:01 <mbff> in my case that doesn't make a ton of sense because that would give them an array of objects that has a length of 1 when they enter a string.
2015-04-11 16:01 <mbff> But that idea could work in other places....

2015-04-11 17:49 khebbie has joined #ruby
2015-04-11 17:49 <centrx> lazy loading of what
2015-04-11 17:49 <shevy> like, I start an app via loop {}, and user input can happen that very moment, while in the background I keep on load/require-ing
2015-04-11 17:49 <centrx> like autoload (MRI or ActiveSupport)?

2015-04-11 17:50 <shevy> oh
2015-04-11 17:50 <shevy> perhaps autoload does that, I'll have a look
2015-04-11 17:50 <jhass> well, autoload defers to first access and blocks that access until it completed
2015-04-11 17:51 <jhass> it's not prefetching in the background like you described
2015-04-11 17:51 <centrx> yeah prefetching is the word, not lazy loading

2015-04-11 19:57 <havenwood> Rafalski: Ruby 1.8 is past end-of-life. Even Ruby 2.0 is in maintenance mode. If possible use Ruby 2.1 or better yet 2.2.
2015-04-11 19:57 <c-c> hm, I think rails no longer supports 1.8
2015-04-11 19:57 rixius has joined #ruby

2015-04-11 19:58 <weaksauce> Rafalski use a VM
2015-04-11 19:58 <havenwood> Rafalski: Probably just use RVM to get the patches.

2015-04-11 20:30 <mbff> what else do i need to change inorder to get the name change to work
2015-04-11 20:30 <havenwood> mbff: what's the error?
2015-04-11 20:30 <mbff> can I keep the Module name the same?
